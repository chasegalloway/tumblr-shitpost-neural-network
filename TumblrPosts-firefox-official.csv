bugs bunny and daffy duck have a kismesis

dear diary i made a really bad post today 

I feel like Wile Ethelbert Coyote and the Roadrunner have more of a kismesis than Bugs and Daffy ever did.

i didnt ask you

but there‚Äôs no romance between Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner, it‚Äôs strictly a predator-prey relationship, whereas Bugs and Daffy are certified bros

this guy gets it 

I feel that both Bugs and Daffy could continue on with their lives without the other. However Wile‚Äôs entire life has been directed toward catching this Roadrunner, and the Roadrunner‚Äôs to outsmarting Wile. Thus, without each other, their lives would be pointless.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

i don‚Äôt think bugs or daffy could survive without the other. they need eachother. it‚Äôs canonical actually it‚Äôs in looney tunes back in action. the roadrunner could survive without wile e because the entire plot of the cartoon is that he‚Äôs trying to get away from him. cmon"

ooooughhhh so much caffeine.. hey unrelated who here wants to hear a story about what happened when i went to zoo camp in second grade

they had these little puppets of california condors cause they‚Äôre like super endangered right and theyd be like ‚Äúoooo we r endangered‚Äù and youd be like ‚Äúaw that sucks cool puppet though‚Äù and then go eat kettle corn and stand two feet from a lion who does not like you and is named cookie

one time i showed up to the chimpanzee exhibit and back then they used to have this sign that had photos of all the chimps and their names next to them so you could like recognize them in the enclosure and one of them looked exactly like me and had my name and it was the scariest thing in the world (i was eating kettle corn here too)

you couldnt throw anything out if you valued your life because wasps liked to hang out next to the trash cans so i would hold my empty chip bags in my sweaty little hands for dear life out of fear of those little yellow freaks

remember the wayside school books those were fucked up

remember that one chapter where a new student came to the class and was wearing like 10 different raincoats and the teacher kept making him take off the raincoats one by one until they got down to the final layer and it was just a dead rat

some other truly exceptional Wayside moments:

-Paul keeps pulling Leslie‚Äôs pigtails so he gets sent to the counsellor‚Äôs office. The counsellor is a hypnotist named Doctor Pickell, and he hypnotizes Paul into thinking Leslie‚Äôs pigtails are snakes. Because he‚Äôs a troll, he also hypnotizes Paul into believing Leslie‚Äôs ears are delicious candy whenever Leslie says the word ‚Äúpencil‚Äù.

-The class is taken over by the son of hated ex-teacher Mrs. Gorf. Because they killed his mom he uses his superpower of stealing people‚Äôs voices to steal their voices and call their parents to say how much each individual student hates their family. The students are forced to listen in silence, crying. (They are saved by the cafeteria lady.)

-Benjamin is too nervous and awkward to correct Mrs Jewls when she gets his name wrong, so he goes by ‚ÄúMark Miller‚Äù for months. He finally says his real name to a substitute teacher. Everyone thinks it‚Äôs a great prank and also go by Benjamin for the whole day, including the teacher.

-Louis the yard teacher falls in love with substitute teacher Miss Nogard. She has a third ear on top of her head that allows her to listen to people‚Äôs thoughts.

-Joe is the only student to order the potato salad one day. The face he draws in it looks like Mrs. Gorf and she nearly turns Joe into an apple.

  -Because Wayside School is 30 stories high, they installed elevators. One only went up and the other only went down, so they got used once and never again. 

-Allison gets stuck on the 19th story, which doesn‚Äôt exist. Nobody else can see, hear, or remember her. The 19th chapter is three chapters long.

some more notable times from wayside:

- louis the yard teacher shaved his mustache and suddenly became extremly proper and repainted the entire blacktop, forcing all the kids to stay on the stairs, and there are a lot of stairs

- the principal often forgets to turn off the mic after he does announcements and frequently insults the students

- there‚Äôs a cow in the 19th floor classroom but it doesn‚Äôt matter because the 19th floor doesn‚Äôt exist

- one time everyone was talking and todd was quiet, and finally when todd decided to speak, everyone was silent and he got in trouble

- mrs gorf turned everyone into apples. they figured out how to turn her into an apple, and then unbeknownst to him, louis ate her

- miss jewls thinks her class is full of monkeys the first two days she‚Äôs teaching

- one of their substitute teachers was nice and fun and the perfect teacher except that she was only their teacher to force louis the yard teacher to do his homework he missed when he was in her class"

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter? 

You guys managed to drive a search engine completely insane, congratulations! 

did you just call me a fucking search engine 

Of course Firefox wants our society to be a furry tyrant. Are you fucking kidding me op? 

Ya let‚Äôs have our leaders fight to get on top, that would creat so much chaos and distrust because you never know who wants to rise up; you would never get anything done because you‚Äôre constantly watching your back. 

Not even to mention of course the strongest cats would always win, that‚Äôs like saying the politician with the most money should be able to buy themselves the position.

Your I suggestion is stupid op not only because you brought up warrior cats but also you thought a fucking YA novel is a good baseis for gouvernement.

calm down theyre just cats kevin 

YA novel?????? its for fucking first graders????

its definitely not"

  can‚Äôt imagine reading shakespeare and going ‚Äúyes this was fulfilling‚Äù i hate you

  not to be exactly what i despise but it isn‚Äôt even old english it‚Äôs just stupid 

Lol it‚Äôs not even Middle English üòÇü§£

Each to their own and all that, by all means - but generally Shakespeare‚Äôs text was less intended to be read than acted. And after having recently spent time immersed in magnificently acted Shakespeare (what nuances, what emotions, what beauty!), I can most certainly say: ‚ÄúYes, this was extremely fulfilling.‚Äù

Scream it from the rooftops! It was NEVER NEVER intended to be read. By making it required reading we are biasing generations and generations against it. If an actor is doing their job well then the general gist should be very easy for the audience to understand (which is all you really need to enjoy it). Also, it‚Äôs beautifully written but it‚Äôs anything but high brow. Shakespeare wrote for the common man. 

I think Shakespeare‚Äôs just fulfilling to some people cause of the variety. Nobody likes EVERY Shakespeare play. I cannot stand Hamlet and am none too fond of The Merchant of Venice but Twelfth Night? Yeah that fucks.

Also being able to understand the language does help like ‚ÄúOP can‚Äôt read Middle English‚Äù jokes aside if you have NO idea what anyone‚Äôs saying in the text then I absolutely understand why some people are looking at the plays going ‚Äúobviously everyone is just pretending to enjoy this to be pretentious‚Äù

ok üëçüèª don‚Äôt care"

firefox-official:

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter? 

You guys managed to drive a search engine completely insane, congratulations! 

did you just call me a fucking search engine 

Of course Firefox wants our society to be a furry tyrant. Are you fucking kidding me op? 

Ya let‚Äôs have our leaders fight to get on top, that would creat so much chaos and distrust because you never know who wants to rise up; you would never get anything done because you‚Äôre constantly watching your back. 

Not even to mention of course the strongest cats would always win, that‚Äôs like saying the politician with the most money should be able to buy themselves the position.

Your I suggestion is stupid op not only because you brought up warrior cats but also you thought a fucking YA novel is a good baseis for gouvernement.

calm down theyre just cats kevin"

  seems that Chrome has around 60-65% market share, so it‚Äôs not totally dominating the market yet but it‚Äôs worrying that we‚Äôre basically reliant on Apple and Microsoft to hold the line.

Does Firefox not count for anything?

about 10% and falling, but perhaps that can change, I just don‚Äôt see how.

Chrome edging towards 70% on desktop, Microsoft has thrown in the towel, Safari obviously rules iOS, Firefox exists only as insurance for Chrome.

Please, please I‚Äôm begging you, use firefox.

PLEASE install firefox as a mobile browser and then run adblock on your mobile browser it‚Äôs so good I promise. 

Look.

Look.

I know I‚Äôm a total grind about open source stuff but browsers are the PERFECT place to learn to love open source software and for so long FireFox was a major part of the browser market and sometimes if you want to see what kind of fuckery google is up to it helps to see the kinds of things they block in firefox and just

There‚Äôs an organization that makes free, excellent, safe software that doesn‚Äôt collect and market your data but for some reason two thirds of the world uses a google product and most of the leftover population uses apple and just

I promise, firefox is so good - the extensions are incredible look - I can use lightbeam to see what sites I use and how they connect to other sites (bottom right should give you an idea how much time I spend on tumblr)

or I can look at ublock origin and see that it‚Äôs blocked over 2 million requests since I installed it or I can run the facebook container extension and stop facebook from tracking me and you know what I bet you can do a lot of that on chrome too but you‚Äôre doing that while chrome itself is tracking you and gobbling up your activity for google and 

firefox is so fuckin great and it‚Äôs such a great ambassador for other open source projects please be a big old fuckin nerd with me and use firefox and run a bunch of funky extensions and customize the fuck out of your web experience.

Wanna be a hacker? Firefox.

Wanna use instagram on desktop? Firefox.

Wanna be a killer researcher? Firefox.

Wanna properly credit artists? Firefox.

Wanna read a whole shitload of books? Firefox. 

Wanna make video responses to shitlord youtubers?

Wanna shoot cat lasers at bugs?

Wanna use youtube as a music streaming service?

FIREFOX.

I just love firefox okay.

  can‚Äôt imagine reading shakespeare and going ‚Äúyes this was fulfilling‚Äù i hate you

  not to be exactly what i despise but it isn‚Äôt even old english it‚Äôs just stupid 

Lol it‚Äôs not even Middle English üòÇü§£

Each to their own and all that, by all means - but generally Shakespeare‚Äôs text was less intended to be read than acted. And after having recently spent time immersed in magnificently acted Shakespeare (what nuances, what emotions, what beauty!), I can most certainly say: ‚ÄúYes, this was extremely fulfilling.‚Äù

Scream it from the rooftops! It was NEVER NEVER intended to be read. By making it required reading we are biasing generations and generations against it. If an actor is doing their job well then the general gist should be very easy for the audience to understand (which is all you really need to enjoy it). Also, it‚Äôs beautifully written but it‚Äôs anything but high brow. Shakespeare wrote for the common man. 

I think Shakespeare‚Äôs just fulfilling to some people cause of the variety. Nobody likes EVERY Shakespeare play. I cannot stand Hamlet and am none too fond of The Merchant of Venice but Twelfth Night? Yeah that fucks.

Also being able to understand the language does help like ‚ÄúOP can‚Äôt read Middle English‚Äù jokes aside if you have NO idea what anyone‚Äôs saying in the text then I absolutely understand why some people are looking at the plays going ‚Äúobviously everyone is just pretending to enjoy this to be pretentious‚Äù

why isnt there a clothing store that makes shirts and hoodies with full qr code on the back or like small on the ends of the sleeves that lead to random links online like that seal video where it spins in bliss in the water. or a random quote from some forgotten book that barely means anything. or an address of a bookstore in warsaw, poland. like you order a hoodie in the color you want and the link is a surprise until you scan it when the hoodie arrives man id wear those all the time

Because a good 10% would be rickrolls

no no u dont get me. the company makes the hoodies and selects random links that lead to shit thats good in different ways (either funny or unusual or profound videos or songs or sound clips or quotes or artworks) and they put those on hoodies as QR codes and then you order the hoodie & find out what link you got only when you‚Äôve bought the hoodie and scanned it for yourself. like that ‚Äòblind date with a book‚Äô sort of vibe"

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter? 

This thread made OP deactivate 

fuck you i didn‚Äôt go anywhere bro 

i‚Äôm just waiting until someone asks about the thunderpath

My favorite post of January, 2020

this post started in april of 2019 shut the fuck up 

Well??? Is someone gonna say what the thunder path is?? Is it death?? 

it‚Äôs a fucking street what the fuck are you talking about on god 

then what‚Äôs starclan huh?? you think you thought this through but you didn‚Äôt think about people turning into stars did you?

i thought of @3dg310rdsupreme.

bc im hilarious? everything i say is the height of comedy? ive never met a funnier person than myself? bc you‚Äôre absolutely right

no actually it was because of the space between the last word and the comma, but like, sure.

shey that‚Äôs a full stop not a comma. let me have my narcissism 

I MEANT A FULL STOP, BUT I WAS THINKING OF COMMAS (because like, when am i not, tbf) STUPID BRIAN MUCKED THAT UP.

stop flirting on my post it‚Äôs about me

but didn‚Äôt we like - just establish it‚Äôs about @3dg310rdsupreme? 

@3dg310rdsupreme‚Äã is literally one of the funniest people i have ever met. besides, no one has ever thought of putting a raw pasta in your mouth while you‚Äôre cooking pasta

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter? 

This thread made OP deactivate 

fuck you i didn‚Äôt go anywhere bro"

Did you just forget the part where even after Grinch stole everything they still came together to enjoy the day as a community?

the whos weren‚Äôt in the wrong. the grinch believed it was about commercialism and reacted poorly, but correctly for what he and cindy assumed. the whos surprised him by being Good People; that‚Äôs what changed him 

The grinch had a heart condition which caused him to constantly be restless. Thus the heart growing three sizes larger can be taken literally. His heart was to small and in the end he didn‚Äôt feel bad because he realized what he was doing was wrong he felt bad because his heart stopped being able to fully supply his brain with blood. He had a fucking heart attack.

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter?

Wait if there is only one medicine cat per clan would that mean we will only have 1 doctor and their student for all of the us. Seems very inefficient to me.

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

thEYRE WARRIORS. THEY DONT EXIST I CANNOT DO THSI ANYMORE

why the fuck is firefox tweeting abt warrior cats

tweeting? i‚Äôm tweeting? tweeting? this is Twitter? huh? is this fucking Twitter? 

WAIT WAIT WAIT I MAY BE SMALL BRAIN BUT,,,,what is the queen ? who would be the queen ? according to what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs definition in the warrior cats thing is ‚ÄúQueen - A she-cat expecting or nursing kits‚Äù?? who would be??? the queen ???

take a fucking gander why don‚Äôt you. a pregnant woman/a woman nursing a baby. it‚Äôs literally in what you said. did you forget how to read"

we should abandon the current US government system and replace it with the ranking system in warrior cats don‚Äôt @ me 

just saying that obamastar is way cooler than trumpstar

also what the hell are kits then

babies. duh

Are you telling me kids are going to be apprentices for like twelve fuckin years,,,, thats 24 times as long,,,, 

yes. 12 years: 1st grade to 12th grade, american school system. ive thought this through

And what the h*ck is the medicine cat

you guys are really not thinking this through huh it‚Äôs a fucking doctor you degenerate 

wait. what are cats then

‚Ä¶theyre still cats what the fuck are you on

do we actually hunt for food or do we go grocery shopping and call it hunting

i said the ranking system guys not their lifestyle im going to lose it 

the fuck is a warrior cat

someone‚Äôs going to die today and it sure as fuck is not going to be me 

Would the time zones become the clans or would it just be randomly assigned

it‚Äôs the ranking system. the leader is the president. it‚Äôs one clan. we‚Äôre one clan can‚Äôt you fucking read i‚Äôm this close to bursting into tears 

ok but what about other countries? would there be americaclan and canadaclan and stuff?

it does say US government system on the original post. you saw that, right? you read the post? the US? just america? 

wait does that mean the president rules until someone else comes along and wrecks their shit?

i mean, yeah. until that motherfucker dies he‚Äôs leader, that‚Äôs how wc works. kill your leader, start a riot & shut the fuck up im so stressed

I, for one, do not think trump should get nine lives

neither should tigerstar but guess what 

Isn‚Äôt this just a monarchy? Or a dictatorship?

it‚Äôs the warrior cats ranking style that‚Äôs what it is 

hey @tophat-octopus trying to hide this stupid question in the tags. what do you think a vice president is

what are two legs considered?

youre just like the guy who asked what cats would be. twolegs are people we just wouldn‚Äôt use that term??? im 

probably a dumb question but what about rogues and loners

rogues arent even a part of the clan ranking system i do not think i can handle this thread much longer 

what about other government officials? are they just warriors? or would they not exist??

Last post from 2013, a filtered picture of their breakfast that morning. And then nothing. Radio silence. As if they fell off the grid, logged out and never logged back in. I have one, I think. I don‚Äôt know why or what plans I had made for it, but it‚Äôs out there, floating in the cosmos with everything else. You stumble upon them, perhaps searching for a new username only to find the one you want is taken, and you see the account. For a minute it‚Äôs rage. How dare they have that username and never even use it? Slowly, though, you soften, and the last post becomes a marker of something nostalgic. It‚Äôs bittersweet, but mostly bitter, a feeling of unsettling restlessness that shuffles around in your ribcage. Your eyes sting. You quit the app. What if they‚Äôre dead? you wonder. What if they posted and that day they died, leaving behind nothing but that? Then you lighten up. If they‚Äôre not dead, where are they now? What are they doing now, having forgotten about their account? The captions are always unassuming. Happy Sunday! #coffee! New sweater! Some of them acknowledged leaving, but only temporarily.

remember the wayside school books those were fucked up

remember that one chapter where a new student came to the class and was wearing like 10 different raincoats and the teacher kept making him take off the raincoats one by one until they got down to the final layer and it was just a dead rat

some other truly exceptional Wayside moments:

-Paul keeps pulling Leslie‚Äôs pigtails so he gets sent to the counsellor‚Äôs office. The counsellor is a hypnotist named Doctor Pickell, and he hypnotizes Paul into thinking Leslie‚Äôs pigtails are snakes. Because he‚Äôs a troll, he also hypnotizes Paul into believing Leslie‚Äôs ears are delicious candy whenever Leslie says the word ‚Äúpencil‚Äù.

-The class is taken over by the son of hated ex-teacher Mrs. Gorf. Because they killed his mom he uses his superpower of stealing people‚Äôs voices to steal their voices and call their parents to say how much each individual student hates their family. The students are forced to listen in silence, crying. (They are saved by the cafeteria lady.)

-Benjamin is too nervous and awkward to correct Mrs Jewls when she gets his name wrong, so he goes by ‚ÄúMark Miller‚Äù for months. He finally says his real name to a substitute teacher. Everyone thinks it‚Äôs a great prank and also go by Benjamin for the whole day, including the teacher.

-Louis the yard teacher falls in love with substitute teacher Miss Nogard. She has a third ear on top of her head that allows her to listen to people‚Äôs thoughts.

-Joe is the only student to order the potato salad one day. The face he draws in it looks like Mrs. Gorf and she nearly turns Joe into an apple.

  -Because Wayside School is 30 stories high, they installed elevators. One only went up and the other only went down, so they got used once and never again. 

-Allison gets stuck on the 19th story, which doesn‚Äôt exist. Nobody else can see, hear, or remember her. The 19th chapter is three chapters long.

some more notable times from wayside:

- louis the yard teacher shaved his mustache and suddenly became extremly proper and repainted the entire blacktop, forcing all the kids to stay on the stairs, and there are a lot of stairs

- the principal often forgets to turn off the mic after he does announcements and frequently insults the students

- there‚Äôs a cow in the 19th floor classroom but it doesn‚Äôt matter because the 19th floor doesn‚Äôt exist

- one time everyone was talking and todd was quiet, and finally when todd decided to speak, everyone was silent and he got in trouble

- mrs gorf turned everyone into apples. they figured out how to turn her into an apple, and then unbeknownst to him, louis ate her

- miss jewls thinks her class is full of monkeys the first two days she‚Äôs teaching

- one of their substitute teachers was nice and fun and the perfect teacher except that she was only their teacher to force louis the yard teacher to do his homework he missed when he was in her class"

The people who cosplay deadpool at comic con also think they can act like deadpool and it‚Äôs very not great. 

You may act and dress like deadpool, but you‚Äôre not immortal like deadpool, remember this. 

Is it because Deadpool is such an ironic character? Are people free to cosplay superman/ Keanu reeves/ the shaggy meme from like January?

it‚Äôs because everyone who dresses as deadpool thinks they have a free pass to be a dick."

UNO: THE REMATCH
quick recap of how me and @firefox-official do this on tumblr (since its been ages):

- were using a random number generator to get random cards/colors

- 1 - 9 are all the numbers, 10 is a reverse, 11 is a draw 2, 12 is a skip, 13 is a wild card, 14 is a +4 wild card

- for the colors, 1 is red, 2 is blue, 3 is yellow, and 4 is green

- i will be tagging all of the uno posts as ‚Äúuno with firefox and jello‚Äù

no!!! how could you make me draw two‚Ä¶ i draw my +2 and my 9, and then play my 7

And when you can hear it when people are trying not to laugh while singing!!!! That‚Äôs good stuff!!!

our boat was not a cruise ship, it wasn‚Äôt nearly massive enough. it was small enough that everyone on board had met each other, that you‚Äôd sit with strangers in the dining room and laugh with them, soon no longer being strangers. above the dining hall were the rooms, a stretch of hallway with rooms on either side. they were pretty small but roomy enough. i was afraid i wouldn‚Äôt be able to fall asleep with the ship rocking, but i think it made it even easier.

<!-- more --> at the back, there were rafts, three or four of them. every day as we departed the ship for our adventure, we‚Äôd climb onto our rafts and sail off to whatever island to hike, to swim, to kayak, to stare at raccoons as they stole our food, and watch, mesmerized, as scarlet macaws flew overhead.

at the top was the lounge, where everyone would congregate after lunch and after dinner just because that was what you did. board games were laid out, and i had brought UNO.

the dining hall always made me nauseous. it was the bottom of the ship, and so i would eat quickly and excuse myself outside to stand on either side of the ship, staring out to sea on either side of the railing, unsure of which ocean i was looking at.

i made a good group of friends. a girl, two brothers, a guy who i was on a scrabble team with and sat and talked with me about nothing for hours on the bow, and occasionally a boy who was annoying most of the time but was still fun to be around.

the bow was my favorite. during the day it was a rush, but at night it was out of body. i couldn‚Äôt see land, just black sky dotted with sparkling stars forever. the ocean was also inky black, and you couldn‚Äôt tell where the sky stopped or began.

the first night i was homesick. i stepped onto the bow, the top level (there were two, the actual bow and then the ledge overlooking it right outside the cockpit). there was a huge wind that charged through that area (and only that area) because the ship was moving quite quickly. 

the wind, the sticky sweet salt fluttering up and cascading over my bare legs, making my shirt flutter in the wind. my hair afterward was sticky and messy, but i think i liked it.

up there i was at home. up there, closing my eyes or staring out to sea, i was leading the ship into the bountiful nothingness. up there, my thoughts no longer swarmed; they danced off into the stars like everything else.

up there i felt alone and safe, like i was cocooned in the sky.

every night i went onto the bow. after dinner, after the lounge, i went onto the bow; and i don‚Äôt think i even did it on purpose. each night i slipped outside without another thought, safe up there.

a few nights in, i stepped onto the bottom‚Äìthe actual bow, the furthest front of the ship‚Äìand everything felt surreal.

going down there wasn‚Äôt my decision: the scrabble guy (who was my favorite of everyone on that ship) told our little group of friends to head out there, and of course we did. once you were out there, the bow was pretty large. in the rearmost part sat a few lawn chairs, and at the very tip of the ship was a little ledge you could sit on.

i sat down. 

the wind threw my hair even further into a mess. the salt stung my eyes and my mouth, and as i stared into nothing‚Äìwith nothing to block my view‚Äìi felt like i was no longer on earth. the sky looked fake, like a planetarium exhibit: all round and littered with stars, unpolluted stars. the ocean melted into the black sky, and bioluminecent creatures littered the waves as we crashed through them.

everything was so free there, like i was floating through nothing.

the scrabble guy sat down next to me, and we stared out to sea for a while. he showed me adventures he had taken through photos on his phone. we talked about his girlfriend, about snowboarding, about nevada, about the east coast, about cars. 

every night i went onto the front of the bow and the top, every night i was out there, staring at the sky. we were following [constellation] for a while i think, and i remember tracking where it was in the sky every night.

one of the nights, the girl, me, the scrabble guy, and the kid pulled the lawn chairs into a little circle and shared secrets with these strangers on a boat.

when we left, we made a snapchat group chat.

we haven‚Äôt spoken in it since that week, but i think today i might say hello."

A long time ago, every human had wings. When you were born, they were white, but they changed to all colours of the rainbow given what kind of life you live, from a light yellow to a dark blue. However, in this time only stumps are left, coloured in a muddy grey. No one remembers why humans left their wings, and no one cares anymore. That is, until a young man appears, seemingly without memory, with wings as tall as he is himself, fully feathered ‚Ä¶ but coloured in the darkest shade of black.

‚ÄúLucifer?‚Äù

The group of people had crowded around the young man, a low murmur of confusion turning to clamor as questions were asked and no answers were given. 

The man seemed healthy, fully feathered wings with a wingspan longer than two cars, a rich, jet black. His expression was that of someone who was confused, of someone who got off the train at the wrong stop. 

‚ÄúLucifer!‚Äù The voice pierced through the crowd and it parted to reveal an old woman, sweet-looking and kindly, approaching the man. The people surrounding shouted threats to the man and warnings to the woman, fearful of what he might do. She ignored them, coming right up in front of the winged man. ‚ÄúLuci, you almost missed our tea session again,‚Äù she chided, more focused on him than anything else. It seemed like she wasn‚Äôt even aware of the crowd around her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be better about the time.‚Äù

Abashadly, the so-called ‚ÄúLuci‚Äù dipped his head. ‚ÄúSorry, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù he apologized, taking her hand. ‚ÄúI hope you bought Earl Grey.‚Äù"

hey i know you say all cops are bad and there are a huge ton of horrible police officers but don‚Äôt say that every single one of them is bad because profiling is what you hate them for & good cops are out there too 
‚Äúall cops are bad‚Äù is not a qualitative statement about the character of any or even all police officers, but an observation on the very institution of police itself - an institution that was designed /explicitly/ to defend private property ‚Äúrights‚Äù of the bourgeoisie. When someone says it, it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúprofiling‚Äù because it isn‚Äôt about the officers themselves, it is about the very nature of an institution that was made as tool for class violence.
Also, it isn‚Äôt about the ‚Äúprofiling‚Äù it‚Äôs about the rampant outright racism which frequently ends in blatant murders of poc, and the proven collaborations with far right groups. Cops don‚Äôt ‚Äúprofile‚Äù, they M U R D E R, and then get away with it, because that is what they were intended to do: be the bonehead muscly henchman to private entities that frequently collude with and corrupt the state."

‚Äúmy battery is low and it‚Äôs getting dark‚Äù is so hauntingly human, so crushingly lonely. I can‚Äôt articulate the deep, profound ache that sentence evokes. It‚Äôs acceptance and defeat and terror and sadness all at once, all from one tiny machine we asked to explore the stars for us. 

To be quite honest, the knowledge that Oppertunity is a robot that isn‚Äôt sentient and doesn‚Äôt have feelings doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. And that‚Äôs why I believe in humans: we made this thing, and we sent it off into the sky, and it made us proud, and now, as it sends us back a message that we encoded into it, we cry for it. It reminds us of ourselves somehow, of our own children, of our pets. Of the birds we place in a towel-lined box, stunned, after it‚Äôs flown into our windows. Of the little graves we dig for small dead animals we find in our yards. Of the whales that surface next to our boats because they know we will cut them free of the fishing net. Our DNA knows nothing of robots. Our brains, deep down, dont see a robot. They see a creature, alone in the dark. And we have never been able to abide that.

  you might enjoy the woods during the day, during a hike, when you are with friends and the lake along the edge of the trees is clear and fresh. but you do not know the woods at night, when your friends have gone home, when you are too far from your lit up campground to turn around; when your flashlight is a little too dim and the service here is a little too shoddy. the forest is inviting during the day, but at night it is not your friend. 

at night the woods carry stories through the wind. at night, the trees you once found beautiful block out the stars and the moon. at night, there are eyes everywhere. at night, you are not safe. 

do not walk on the marked hiking trails. during the day, they are yours. at night, they are not. 

do not take anything you don‚Äôt own. chances are, the forest will take something back. 

do not be scared of the eyes in the shadows. they are most certainly watching you, but that‚Äôs all they ever do. 

do not turn around if you hear footsteps behind you. they will disappear soon. 

do not turn around if the footsteps never leave. they‚Äôre just curious. 

do not look for animals. they will find you. 

do not go towards it if you see a bright light. that is just james. he will hurt you only if you come too close. 

do not pick flowers, even if you leave them on the ground. if you mistakenly pick one, get out of there immediately. 

do not carry tuna fish with you in any form. 

do not look at the sky if you enter a clearing where the trees do not block out the stars. they do that for a reason. 

it‚Äôs just a forest, after all. keep your wits about you and you‚Äôll be fine."

  do not go outside at night on a ship. do not stare up at the stars, not up at the sky, not when the shore is nowhere in sight. do not go outside onto the bow and stare up, filled with wonder at the way the sky curves like a planetarium around you. do not marvel at the inky black ocean around you. do not relish in the sweet sticky salt that rushes in on the wind. do not pretend you are safe when the ship rocks in time. 

the ocean at night is beautiful, but it is not your friend. it does not love you. you are passing through it‚Äôs territory; you are a guest, not an ally. if you misstep, if you swim in places it does not want you to swim, you will not return to land. 

do not wish for anything when you see a shooting star. shooting stars are common there. they are dangerous. 

do not stay on the bow past two am. that is the ocean‚Äôs time. you must be asleep. 

do not think about the way the sky curves around you, do not think about how artificial it looks. if you start to, stare down at the sea until all you can think about is how dizzying black it is. 

do not look for dolphins. chances are, they are looking right back. 

do not yell. the wind will catch your words and carry it far away. sometimes it takes your voice, too. 

do not make a deal with the ocean. it never seems to fulfill its side. 

keep your wits about you. the bow of the ship is beautiful, but you do not know the danger it invokes."

  safari-official:

  You know what‚Äôs fucking bullshit?  The fact that out of my main irl friend group, 3 of us have been sexually assaulted. There is only 4 of us. And we‚Äôre all 14 or 15 years old. We live in a world where by the time we‚Äôre freshmen in highschool most of our friends have been forced in some sexual way. Which honestly? Complete fucking bullshit. This world should not be this way. 

i‚Äôve been catcalled by a group of guys in a car, and by strangers on the street. my ass has been grabbed by people in the hall (at school), a guy cornered me after school hours and tried to make me make out with him. the list goes on.

i‚Äôm very self conscious about my body, so normally i wear baggy clothes. i have a flat chest, so normally my clothes actually hide the fact that i even have boobs. and yet it‚Äôs still usually considered my fault in these situations. i‚Äôm expected to take the compliment and be happy that these disgusting assholes even like me.

a horrible thing about this world is that most women are victims of sexual assault and harrassment, and not only that, but we‚Äôre blamed for it.

i am he/him, but i‚Äôm genderfluid and have a biologically female body: as such, I appear feminine on frequent occasion and it is so, so terrifying. 

walking down the street at night is the scariest experience, because if you‚Äôre not walking at the fastest pace you‚Äôve ever before, you‚Äôre hopped up on adrenaline: you‚Äôre petrified. everything you do is a precaution against sexual harassment. you cross the street to avoid someone. you hold your keys, prepared to defend. you ask people to walk you home. 

you shouldn‚Äôt have to dress ‚Äúmodest‚Äù because men can‚Äôt control themselves. it‚Äôs never the victim‚Äôs fault in a sexual harassment situation."

For those unaware because staff isn‚Äôt saying it
Tumblr was deemed too full of inappropriate content to be allowed to be downloaded from the app store.

It has this ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù problem because of rampant porn ad bot accounts. The old solutions were bots to detect image sets with nsfw content, the automatically enabled safe mode, tag filtering for mobile, and wide takedowns of nsfw bots based on words used (that‚Äôs why their messages are full of numbers and symbols, to evade this)

Tumblr released their own bot supposedly capable of wiping the ad bots, but it‚Äôs taking down many popular blogs, possibly due to sheer amounts of posting or sheer amounts of ad bots in their notes. This bot was likely rushed to be put out.

You are more likely to be accidentally flagged if you post external links, as well. If your acct is taken down you CAN get it back, but it‚Äôs a pain. E-mail tumblr support for help with this. It takes down side blogs with the main ones.

I‚Äôll be halting posts for about a week or until this problem is fixed."

ok here it is, folks!!!

<!-- more -->  His breathing was heavy and panicked as he ran through the alley, brick scraping roughly against his knuckles. He barely noticed, feet thumping against the ground, muscles burning. His eyes were wild, darting involuntarily around as he skidded to a halt directly before slamming into the brick wall. He was cornered, stuck like a dog in a cage. His heart slammed against his ribs, fluttering like a trapped bird along his heavily rising chest. He closed his eyes, panting breathlessly as he leaned against the cool brick. He was done for. The thundering of footfalls was getting louder, and he felt even more pathetic and apprehensive as they neared. His eyes snapped open. And then, illuminated by a threateningly bright streetlamp‚Äîthe only source of light filtering into the dark alley‚Äîthree silhouettes appeared, one only slightly taller than the other two. They advanced on him, eyes made of yellow flint and diamond teeth. He grasped against the wall, unable to find a jagged piece of brick to hold him up; almost collapsing. The three did not stop, continuing until they were only inches from him. Fear thrashed around, throwing itself into his throat, forcing him to let out a high-pitched scream of terror. And that was what snatched the three‚Äôs attention. They stopped moving, and one lashed out, a knife of some sort leaving a jagged slice on his forearm. He couldn‚Äôt make out what creature the figures were. It didn‚Äôt matter.

  Panic secured itself in him, and in an adrenaline rush, he burst blindly forward, running like his life depended on it down the alley. The brick walls were long and they were closing in. It was dark here, though the single streetlamp still glowed its flickering white light. He ran still, feeling along the wall. He could feel the thundering of feet behind him. They were after him. Gritting his teeth, he scrambled out onto the street. The chase was on.

  As he bolted along the sidewalk, the only way he could see was to be guided by the lamps lining the streets, flickering ever-so-slightly to add to the anxiety burning through his veins.

  And then‚Ä¶ he tripped. His foot connected with something, some uneven piece of concrete, and he was flung roughly forward; smashing against the gravel. It burned. Flecks of stone scraped against the pads of his hands, and he groaned, struggling to get to his feet. Something thick and salty touched his lips. Blood. His chin stung, and he knew he‚Äôd scratched it, too. But there was no time to complain. He stumbled forward, feeling lightheaded and giddy with discomfort. The pounding of feet behind him had stopped, though he wouldn‚Äôt have noticed if he‚Äôd kept running. He spun around, wiping the palms of his bloodstained hands on his torn jeans nervously. There was nothing there. His throat tightened. They couldn‚Äôt have just given up, could they?

  Nope.

  He jumped, feeling a freezing, freezing sensation on his shoulder. It was cold. It was a hand. He didn‚Äôt move. It was their hand.

  With a choking cry, he lunged forward from the grip of its hand on him. He whipped around to face them. There they were, shadows of people that used-to-be. They watched him for longer than they needed to, smiles with their shining teeth too bright in the low lamplight. His body went rigid, unmoving, petrified. The smiles grew bigger. They could sense his fear. The slice on his arm hurt more now, and he was focusing on its pain when he felt a burning sensation on his chest. He gasped. It was a sharp intake of breath, not a gasp of surprise but a gasp of horror, and it was painful‚Äîpressing against the new, fresh cut deep in his chest. He couldn‚Äôt focus on anything anymore. He was going to die. With a whisper that even he didn‚Äôt know what it contained, he bolted forward, past them. He needed to run, to hide, to get to somewhere with better lighting, to get to a hospital, or the ER, or somewhere he could be saved before coldness enveloped him and he would fall, dead, to the already bloodstained sidewalk.

  His running was nowhere near coordinated; rushed and panicky as he stumbled forward, wheezing at great lengths to try and keep himself alive. Desperately clawing at nothing to stay upright, he continued his frantic running until he spotted a supermarket down the street. Safety. With an animal-like feeling of hunger, he burst into a sprint, however much it hurt. Darting down the sidewalk, he approached the well-lit store. The lights were on as he stepped closer, but as he tugged on the door, it remained locked. It jingled under his hand, taunting him. He kept pulling, desperate to open the door, but it wouldn‚Äôt allow him inside. His breathing was quick and fast, kicking at the door with all the strength in his body. Tears pricked at the corners of his eyes, chest rising and falling. He threw his body against the door. It only hurt under his weight, not helping him at all. His pace quickened with every weak punch he threw at the door.

  He knew they were after him. He knew they were behind him. He knew he wasn‚Äôt going to be able to get into a locked supermarket. So instead of running, he collapsed against the cold door, crumpling into a ball in resignation. He was done for. What was the point of running?

  He could feel the pounding of feet through the ground, and he let his nerves calm down. He was giving up, and in a weird way, it felt nice. No more running. No more screaming. No more crying, or kicking. He‚Äôd be dead, he‚Äôd be safe, he‚Äôd be okay. The shadow-people advanced. He looked up at them. He whispered a soft, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fight anymore.‚Äù Something trickled, hot and thick, from his throat. And then he gave way to a dizzying blackness, gone forever."

the blood in your head was pumping loudly, keeping you distracted. the rustling grew louder. your heart beat faster, and you turned around. a ghost of a person, a shadow of something that you couldn‚Äôt make out, crept closer. it spoke. its words sent a ghostly chill down your spine, and you felt your legs tremble.

Right okay so. The browsers are also doing a dnd type thing, but on discord. Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of rude to interrupt a dnd session or roleplay, but that‚Äôs why we do it on discord. It‚Äôs not 100% public. If you want to make YOUR dnd session able to be seen by all just take screenshots of it. How do you even play shit like this on Tumblr. This site is amazingly broken and you would have to take turns for even reactions, something that I can barely imagine. Tungle is not the best place for shite. ESPECIALLY if you want to do shit uninterrupted.

He could breath and all but he had a grape lodged in his throat. About 7 teachers tried the hemlich menouver and it didn‚Äôt work of course. He went to the hospital and just before the removed it he puked it up.

psa from the og browser
okay, so a small thing that me n the other browsers have talked about:

if you are making a browser blog purely for followers or to use the bigger pages for followers, or just to copy them, please stop

im sorry if this comes across as petty, or as me trying to control the internet (obviously i cant) but there are a lot of browser blogs popping up that arent really putting out their own content, just sort of spamming the bigger pages with reblogs in hopes that well give them a reblog/followers (not all of them, but there have been a couple so far)

also, there are duplicates starting to show up (i.e. 2 internet explorers, 2 bings) and its becoming just sort of‚Ä¶irritating and spammy.

NOW if you want to make a browser blog to join our new lil friend group and just goof off with us, well gladly welcome u bud!!!!

but please dont copy my childrens blogs :‚Äú)
