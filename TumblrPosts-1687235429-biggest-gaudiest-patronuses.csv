a group of children are tasked by a mysterious wizard to complete a heroic quest in a magical land. since this is a form a kidnapping, their middle-aged parents follow them through the portal and precede to wreak havoc in the style of Liam Neeson’s Taken 

Do the parents have their own magical skills, or mundane skills, or just immense righteous fury? 

I vote one of each. 

#‘Taken to Fairyland’ #a wand a shotgun and a frying pan #let’s gooo

At least two of the parents were also Chosen Children, and they are the only survivors of their group. Like hell is the damn immortal wizard using THEIR children for that impossible Quest! Again! 

Emma wrapped her hand around a weed, and yanked. It popped out, roots and all - she might not have magic here, but she still had a touch with plants that few could rival. The weeds weren’t going to choke out her carrots, not while she had two hands and the disposition of a particularly persistent patch of ivy.

She’d nearly won the argument with the weeds over who got to use the vegetable patch when she heard a noise from her nightmares. A kind of ringing whistle, like the hum of a wineglass mixed with the sound of storm winds under the eaves.

A Portal.

once again for the bargain price of $6.66 i will present to you a Top 5 Childhood Misadventures: April Fool’s Edition 

Presenting:

The Saga Of The Stolen Door Ah, to be young and filled with mirth and rage.

I was 14 at the time. 14 was not a good year for me. New town, new house, new school to adjust to, and that’s not even counting the complications of being an Undiagnosed Autistic Teenager. Ah, puberty. You think you’re finally catching up, and suddenly there’s a whole parade of shiny new developmental delays to widen the gap between you and your peers. Ah, nostalgia.

Point is, it was a difficult year for me and my 2 siblings. So when April rolled around? I decided, quite magnanimously I thought, a sign of benevolence of character and all that, that we all deserved a good laugh.

Well, that is one version of events. 

The second version of events is: my siblings and I had spend the year driving each other up the walls. Up the walls, through the ceiling, past the colony of attic-dwelling dust bunnies, around the rafters and straight to cracking our skulls on the new roofing tiles (terracotta).

The thing about the house we were living in at the time…it was weird. It was a weird house. Rooms with too many corners. Windows shoved in bizarre places. Odd flourishes of grandeur.

It occurs to me, in hindsight (glorious, alluring, unobtainable hindsight), that if one is determined to go about removing a door in this manner, there is probably a correct order in which to remove screws from a doorframe.

I did not choose that order.

At this point, it may have occurred to some of you that I am not much of a planner.

Dear Reader, let me snatch back my words. Earlier, I compared my tale to the Tragedy of Icarus. This was not wholly accurate, because you will note that Icaraus’s primary tragedy was that he was an insipid little bitch who couldn’t get his act together.

Let us skip ahead.

FINAL CHAPTER

one final detail, the briefest epilogue, the cherry & sprinkles atop the sundae.

(I’m not 100% sure my memory is accurate on this part, and I’m too scared to ask Claire, but from what I personally remember) not only did it take her 3 days to realize her bedroom door was missing: when she finally noticed, it was specifically because she was having an argument with Mom. 

She tried to slam the door and–surprise :)

ko-fi

am worried some of you (wisely) neglected to click ‘keep reading’, in which case you missed my exquisite illustrations

fun fact: the pink ass in the last panel is modeled on a classical painting of Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the mountain. That is Sisyphus’s ass.

SISYPHASS  No wonder he never reaches the top, he’s pushing a boulder and dragging a dumptruck

wait so blood curses are passed on through blood…does this mean they count as an STD? do vampires inherit blood curses if their victims are a carrier? do adopted children also inherit blood curses or is it biological offspring only? if a father offends a witch and contracts a blood curse, would that pass down to his already-born children or only to any children born after-the-fact? i have questions which demand answers

I suggest that all options are possible, and it depends on the person doing the cursing. This can be either intentional, to fit the circumstances, or subconscious for maximum confusion. 

Witch A: “I cursed that jerk good, and got anything even remotely childlike in his life. Even that car he loves so much keeps blowing tires now.”

Witch B: “I just dashed off the spell and didn’t think about it. Probably a lot of people in his family are going to have painful rashes, though.”

Vampire, with a red face and a sprained ankle: “Which if you do I have to blame for this?? Answer quickly, or you both die.”

why are birds so cursed

A Non-Comprehensive List of Birds That Piss Me Off 1. Dracula Parrot. This thing pisses me off like, a bunch

2. King Vulture. the felted craft project equivalent of a haunted ventriloquist dummy

  i will never not resent this bird 

  3. Jacana Bird. This is the most unnecessary cursed nonsense. i deserve an apology for having to look at this. I can feel its fingers stroking my ears

No it does not have SIX FREAKING LIMBS. it’s carrying its stupid creepy spawn under its wings. A+ parents but still, piss off. even the normal 2 legged version isn’t much better

put those AWAY.

4. The Shoebill, which i’m sure we’re all sick of hearing about. this thing is the epitome of a crappy photorealistic cgi disney villainy. i despise this bird.

also this is what they look like standing up. i just feel like i shouldn’t have to deal with that, i really do.

5. Inca Tern. truly, hipsters ruin everything

6. Tragopan. it looks like a star wars species, which i dislike on principle 

7. The Secretary Bird. it wears yoga pants.

also i’m uncomfortable with the length of its eyelashes

8. finally, i really dislike this one specific parakeet

in conclusion, these birds exist to haunt me and this knowledge is a burden. birds exist to observe our sin; always watching, they are filled with malice. flee from them

this was intended as an humorous post but based on replies some of u have been genuinely cursed i think"

Stage 1: your local tap water is potable (safe to drink), but at-home water filtration products are marketed to increase “flavor” and “purity.” these products are not actually capable of sanitizing unsafe water, and do not replace access to clean water. meanwhile, “lifestyle” bottled water becomes more popular due to heavy marketing. bottled water is not a necessity, but a stylish accessory. Stage 2: your tap water is probably potable. the public water system is entering decline. poor and rural areas are at risk, but access to clean water is not seen as a mainstream issue. meanwhile, at-home filter technology has become more advanced. consumers are now familiar with filtration products (most have a starter product such as a 'Brita’) and more willing to invest in higher-cost options. however, only the most expensive filtration can actually replace access to clean water–at this point, drinkable tap water is still the expectation, and its absence would cause serious inconvenience to the middle-class (who prefer but are not reliant on bottled and home-filtered water).  Stage 3: the public water system is solidly in decline. the quality of your tap water is deteriorating. Its safety is unknown and regarded with suspicion. when you call the public utilities department to complain, they recommend buying a water filter. you contact your local representatives, but they are unconcerned–you are one of a small number of callers (most people just buy a home filter), and you aren’t wealthy enough for your vote to matter (if you were, you would already own a home filter). reluctantly, you pick up a few gallons of water from the grocery store, and pull out your phone to look up water filter brands. your more vulnerable neighbors have fewer options–many continue to drink the water, aware that they are being exposed to unknown health risks beyond their control. Stage 4: the public water system is collapsing. your tap water is not potable. it will make you sick. this is acceptable because at-home filtration–now advanced enough to replace safe tap water–is a commonplace appliance in middle-class households. lower-income groups must rely on rented/community filters or bottled water. expensive and often aspirational, home filters are now analogous to washing machines: where the middle-class can wash their clothes & filter their water at home, those on tight budgets must rely on laundromats & water delivery. the rich of course don’t give a damn–they have cleaners to do their laundry, and their taps are connected to a clean private source.  (and, of course, they own stock in Nestle.)"

Emma wrapped her hand around a weed, and yanked. It popped out, roots and all - she might not have magic here, but she still had a touch with plants that few could rival. The weeds weren’t going to choke out her carrots, not while she had two hands and the disposition of a particularly persistent patch of ivy.

She’d nearly won the argument with the weeds over who got to use the vegetable patch when she heard a noise from her nightmares. A kind of ringing whistle, like the hum of a wineglass mixed with the sound of storm winds under the eaves.

A Portal.

“why do we even have that lever” is made funnier by the fact there are only 2 levers to begin with (disguised as a pair of tusks on a statue)

i find the implications hilarious:

kronk only had to remember the location of one lever, and couldn’t even manage that but on the other hand, it’s easy to get two identical unlabelled levers confused, this one’s on yzma tbh  yzma only needed to make one lever to begin with, but she actively chose to turn the second tusk into a functioning trapdoor. she could have just…just not connected the second tusk to anything. it didn’t need to have a function upon reflection, this also answers the question itself: “why do we even HAVE that lever?” it’s because yzma herself specifically designed it as a booby trap. “why do we have that lever?” because yzma had it built to keep people out of her secret lair! yzma made the very purposeful choice to put that lever there! and then both she and her inept henchman immediately forgot about her own booby trap! yzma that is YOUR LEVER!!!!!ALT brilliant brilliant brilliant I say!!! wow u guys really liked my colossal unreadable wall of tags on this one huh:

#GENIUS I TELL YOU #the worse thing about this is how it makes Actual Practical Sense. i mean like. say you get held at gunpoint and forced to reveal your Super Secret Supervillain Lair–you can just. pull the wrong lever and watch your nemesis fall into the crocodile pit. that’s what i hate the most. how it is a ENTIRELY PRACTICAL DESIGN. because.. because LOOK at Yzma. NOTHING SHE DOES IS PRACTICAL. (she and kronk are just team rocket but without a Meowth to cancel out their natural dominance/submissive energies YES I FUCKING SAID IT)

 #anyways. the point is that they are both equally and oppositely insane. and will never ever ever be part of the same functioning workspace/office ecosystem #(emphasis on FUNCTIONING) 

 #so there is no WAY either one of them came up with this and convinced the other to follow through. they just don’t have that level of competence. as i’ve said many times before: Yzma! is only! competent-passing! bc she specifically hires the Most Himbo Of Himbos to stand next to her. and Kronk is actually extremely-and-weirdly-competent. just not at anything in his Actual Job Description. so again. team rocket coded but if the narrative stopped interrupting them with a spray bottle every time Jesse tried to assert dominance

Ishtar was six thousand years old, which was approximately too-fucking-old to be dealing with this nonsense.  (She wasn’t certain what, precisely, an Email was, but She liked the sound of it.) An outrageously muscled man burst into the room, trailed nervously by a tornado. The man had a trident and very little in the way of clothes; the tornado was dripping onto the carpet.  Poseidon gestured helplessly at the giant sea serpent, which was wagging its tail. YOU WANT TO…SLITHER. UP THE SUEZ CANAL. The three faces stared guiltily up at Her. Well, two of them looked guilty. The third was a crocodile.  “Am I telling you Osiris engineered Brexit? I’m not telling you Osiris didn’t engineer Brexit.”
anyways i want you to know i was devastated, i was on the floor sobbing, when they unstuck the boat on March 29.

woke up and someone spilled vanilla extract all over my dash, so as punishment you strange little beasties are getting all the VANILLA FACTS i know:

vanilla is the 2nd most expensive spice in the world (2nd to saffron) which is why more than 99% of what we call “vanilla extract” is actually vanillin (vanilla’s dominant flavor compound) and is not extracted from real vanilla. luckily, even professionals struggle to tell the difference when it comes to things like baked goods. but there is a distinct difference in non-heat treated products like vanilla ice cream. real vanilla has a more complex, individualized flavor profile. why is vanilla so expensive? because it is a ridiculously delicate & demanding crop. complete primadonna. vanilla beans come from vanilla orchids. these crazy flowers bloom for A SINGLE DAY and have to be HAND-POLLINATED in a process that is exhausting, delicate, and requires specialist knowledge passed down over generations.  then, if you’re lucky, you get vanilla beans.  which then require months of further specialized treatment. the entire process takes about a year and can go wrong at any stage vanilla has been cultivated for over 800 years (possibly much longer). the first known cultivators are the Totonac, an indigenous people of Mexico.  the Aztecs used it as a sweetener to balance out the bitter taste of cocoa. it was popular in a drink called xocolatl–the precursor to modern hot chocolate! it is only pollinated by a very specific orchid bee!!!  which is why no fruit could be grown outside of Mexico until the 1800s Edmond Albius, born into slavery, invented the pollination method we still use today–launching a global industry when he was just 12 years old. today, the majority of the world’s vanilla is grown in Madagascar if you want real vanilla, read the labels carefully–it’s harder to find than you think!  in conclusion, those tiny black specks you see in fancy vanilla ice cream? those are vanilla bean seeds! itty bitty orchid seeds!!! they are delicious and also a PRISSY BITCH!

“Why do you ask?” Allistic people tend to ask one question when they actually mean something quite different (this is one of many ways in which allistic people are strange and exotic). So when I don’t want to hazard guessing, my default response is to cheerfully respond to ambiguous questions with “Why do you ask?” 

Usually if I do it casually, people don’t notice I didn’t answer the original question, and instead move on to their Actual Question. (Also works if you just prefer to give noncommittal answers.) Very very basic example but:

Person: “Are you busy/what are you doing this weekend?”

You (too tired to guess-and-then-calculate-an-emotional-slash-external-response based on if this is a prelude to a social invitation, an acquaintance asking for a favor, a coworker asking to trade shifts, boss wanting you to work overtime, etc): *vague but friendly smile* Why do you ask?

bitch you are a member of one of the most social species in existence! it is actually insane the extent to which humans have evolved to use cooperation as our main survival tool. humans have been building and then rebuilding societies for as long as disasters have been bringing them down. an apocalypse would be fucking awful, but the survivors would end up building communities and networks and pooling resources and knowledge, because that’s what humans do. that’s what they DO!!!

This reminds me of a really great video by Sarah Zedig where the second half is her going off on apocalyptic, grimdark shows such as The Walking Dead as a ‘libertarian power fantasy where their dogshit ideology is never wrong’ and I’ve never forgotten it.

At its core, the edgelord trope that society would “break down” into violence the instant the cops stop answering the phones is a myth built on cynical belief that humans are - at their core - violent, selfish, cruel animals that are only kept in line with the violent enforcement of “law and order.” 

Hell, it’s a myth built atop another myth that the police - the legitimate purveyors of state violence - are even competent at all!

Considering their abysmal track record for actually solving crimes and observed reluctance to put themselves in harm’s way, there’s hardly a case to be made that they are actively keeping society from descending into chaos. And if you think that’s woke anti-police nonsense, bear in mind that once, when the cops in New York did a work “slowdown”, crime went down. 

Because see, there’s a second half to the apocalyptic “breakdown of society” myth, the one that appeals to a certain group of people. It’s the part where, now that society has become the State of Nature, the truly strong, independent, well-armed men of action have carte blanche to “restore order” with brutal, justified violence. 

Apocalyptic movies are a popular genre because it takes the standard Hollywood power fantasy and gives it an adrenaline shot of compatible politics: libertarian, every man for himself, Übermensch crap. As it depicts the end of the world, with all the pornographic spectacle of chaos and human cruelty, it tells its audience that you won’t succumb when the rest those dumb, weak masses perish. Whether it’s zombies, plague, climate disaster, or solar flares making our cellphones stop working, you specifically

(yes you, Kyle!) will rise above it. 

And when it does, the strong and rugged will survive and start over. Make things how they “used to be.” Presumably a nice, pure, uncomplicated world suspiciously absent of all those “weak” folks that had been muddying the waters and getting in the way, before. The ones that had prevented the naturally strong men from reaching their true potential in the Old World. 

To the people that truly buy into this garbage power fantasy, the inevitable apocalyptic collapse isn’t something to be feared, but prepared for.

They’re looking forward to it.

once again for the bargain price of $6.66 i will present to you a Top 5 Childhood Misadventures: April Fool’s Edition 

Presenting:

The Saga Of The Stolen Door Ah, to be young and filled with mirth and rage.

I was 14 at the time. 14 was not a good year for me. New town, new house, new school to adjust to, and that’s not even counting the complications of being an Undiagnosed Autistic Teenager. Ah, puberty. You think you’re finally catching up, and suddenly there’s a whole parade of shiny new developmental delays to widen the gap between you and your peers. Ah, nostalgia.

Point is, it was a difficult year for me and my 2 siblings. So when April rolled around? I decided, quite magnanimously I thought, a sign of benevolence of character and all that, that we all deserved a good laugh.

Well, that is one version of events. 

The second version of events is: my siblings and I had spend the year driving each other up the walls. Up the walls, through the ceiling, past the colony of attic-dwelling dust bunnies, around the rafters and straight to cracking our skulls on the new roofing tiles (terracotta).

The thing about the house we were living in at the time…it was weird. It was a weird house. Rooms with too many corners. Windows shoved in bizarre places. Odd flourishes of grandeur.

It occurs to me, in hindsight (glorious, alluring, unobtainable hindsight), that if one is determined to go about removing a door in this manner, there is probably a correct order in which to remove screws from a doorframe.

I did not choose that order.

At this point, it may have occurred to some of you that I am not much of a planner.

Dear Reader, let me snatch back my words. Earlier, I compared my tale to the Tragedy of Icarus. This was not wholly accurate, because you will note that Icaraus’s primary tragedy was that he was an insipid little bitch who couldn’t get his act together.

one final detail, the briefest epilogue, the cherry & sprinkles atop the sundae.

(I’m not 100% sure my memory is accurate on this part, and I’m too scared to ask Claire, but from what I personally remember) not only did it take her 3 days to realize her bedroom door was missing: when she finally noticed, it was specifically because she was having an argument with Mom. 

She tried to slam the door and–surprise :)

ko-fi

am worried some of you (wisely) neglected to click ‘keep reading’, in which case you missed my exquisite illustrations

fun fact: the pink ass in the last panel is modeled on a classical painting of Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the mountain. That is Sisyphus’s ass.

SISYPHASS  No wonder he never reaches the top, he’s pushing a boulder and dragging a dumptruck

My favorite practical joke of all time: that one student who convinced an entire college that a Rhinocerus escaped from the zoo and drowned in the campus lake. This was achieved by:

A rhino-foot wastebasket, borrowed from a professor The surreptitious application of footprints in the snow leading up to the banks of a frozen lake. A lake with a conspicuous, potentially rhinoceros-sized hole in the ice… Just one of many shining moments in the career of infamous practical joker Hugh Troy

This has got to be one of the greatest pranks ive seen

I also recommend Stealing Park Benches!

Or disassembling the professor’s car and reassembling it around a statue!

personally I’m a fan of the Cambridge classic, Car on A University Rooftop

engineering students built a crane from scratch to lift it up there!

bonus:

Okay but having lived in Cambridge my whole life I must now add to this. Students of Cambridge have a long history of car pranks. 

Following the austin seven on the roof of Senate House in ‘58, a group of students in ‘63 hung an Austin seven from the bridge of sighs

The dealer who’s shop it was from was offering it for £2 with no engine or gearbox. 

They punted it down the canal and strung it up. 

In ‘68 the prank was repeated with a reliant regal three wheeler, though less of a fanfare was made and I can’t find any photos of it. But despite supporting two cars, the bridge sustained no damage. Still stands today. (It was the bridge to connect the first accommodation block on the other side of the river to the campus buildings, and so it is joked that students sighed as they were dragged from their beds to their exams, much like Byron’s (also a Cambridge lad) assessment of the Ponte dei Sospiri in Venice that the prisoners would sigh at their last beautiful view of Venice before they were led to their cells). 

Then in ‘85 another prank was pulled when a fiat was propped up on stilts in the cam 

There’s not much info about who did this, though a good assumption is either students or workers from the science park. 

In ‘89 the Cambridge car club took part in the annual raft race with a reliant robin 

My dad was there. Did a lot of the photography for the raft race each year. Speaking of, his work’s newsletter article for the 1990 raft race (I thought I could find the ‘89 one and see if I could find any of his photos of it, but alas it’s twenty to five in the morning and I haven’t slept)

Anyway, back to cars. In 2013 they ‘recreated’ the original car on senate house prank. When I say recreated, I mean they recreated the crane and scaffold they used to get it up, and demonstrated how it worked with a platform instead of actually using senate house. Many of us were disappointed in that. 

Based on the many stories recounted in the notes, college students and high school seniors are obsessed with putting automobiles in ludicrously inconvenient locations and that has a certain beauty!"

woke up and someone spilled vanilla extract all over my dash, so as punishment you strange little beasties are getting all the VANILLA FACTS i know:

vanilla is the 2nd most expensive spice in the world (2nd to saffron) which is why more than 99% of what we call “vanilla extract” is actually vanillin (vanilla’s dominant flavor compound) and is not extracted from real vanilla. luckily, even professionals struggle to tell the difference when it comes to things like baked goods. but there is a distinct difference in non-heat treated products like vanilla ice cream. real vanilla has a more complex, individualized flavor profile. why is vanilla so expensive? because it is a ridiculously delicate & demanding crop. complete primadonna. vanilla beans come from vanilla orchids. these crazy flowers bloom for A SINGLE DAY and have to be HAND-POLLINATED in a process that is exhausting, delicate, and requires specialist knowledge passed down over generations.  then, if you’re lucky, you get vanilla beans.  which then require months of further specialized treatment. the entire process takes about a year and can go wrong at any stage vanilla has been cultivated for over 800 years (possibly much longer). the first known cultivators are the Totonac, an indigenous people of Mexico.  the Aztecs used it as a sweetener to balance out the bitter taste of cocoa. it was popular in a drink called xocolatl–the precursor to modern hot chocolate! it is only pollinated by a very specific orchid bee!!!  which is why no fruit could be grown outside of Mexico until the 1800s Edmond Albius, born into slavery, invented the pollination method we still use today–launching a global industry when he was just 12 years old. today, the majority of the world’s vanilla is grown in Madagascar if you want real vanilla, read the labels carefully–it’s harder to find than you think!  in conclusion, those tiny black specks you see in fancy vanilla ice cream? those are vanilla bean seeds! itty bitty orchid seeds!!! they are delicious and also a PRISSY BITCH!

Aren’t orchids the fungi parasites? And one of the most varied flower in the world makes vanilla‽

you really had to bring up the “orchids start life by parasitizing fungi” post? u really had to do that right in front of my vanilla"

Don’t worry! The boats just turn into submarines when the sink! They don’t actually take any damage, they just travel underwater to get a snack for being such good boats!

logically i know this, but it’s still reassuring to hear someone say it out aloud

And! When they do a really really really good job they are given boat belly rubs! and an extra warm boat bath! I am glad I could be of help to reassure you my friend!

why do we praise boats like this
boats are an invasive species and danger to the ocean and all of its natural wildlife like sharks and shipwreaks

okay wow that is a MASSIVE generalization, the boat genus has evolved over thousands of years and consists of hundreds of subspecies many of which are perfectly capable of living as part of a balanced aquatic ecosystem. boats aren’t automatically evil just because *you personally* think they’re big and scary.

“why do we even have that lever” is made funnier by the fact there are only 2 levers to begin with (disguised as a pair of tusks on a statue)

i find the implications hilarious:

kronk only had to remember the location of one lever, and couldn’t even manage that but on the other hand, it’s easy to get two identical unlabelled levers confused, this one’s on yzma tbh  yzma only needed to make one lever to begin with, but she actively chose to turn the second tusk into a functioning trapdoor. she could have just…just not connected the second tusk to anything. it didn’t need to have a function upon reflection, this also answers the question itself: “why do we even HAVE that lever?” it’s because yzma herself specifically designed it as a booby trap. “why do we have that lever?” because yzma had it built to keep people out of her secret lair! yzma made the very purposeful choice to put that lever there! and then both she and her inept henchman immediately forgot about her own booby trap! yzma that is YOUR LEVER!!!!!ALT brilliant brilliant brilliant I say!!!
wow u guys really liked my colossal unreadable wall of tags on this one huh:

#GENIUS I TELL YOU #the worse thing about this is how it makes Actual Practical Sense. i mean like. say you get held at gunpoint and forced to reveal your Super Secret Supervillain Lair–you can just. pull the wrong lever and watch your nemesis fall into the crocodile pit. that’s what i hate the most. how it is a ENTIRELY PRACTICAL DESIGN. because.. because LOOK at Yzma. NOTHING SHE DOES IS PRACTICAL. (she and kronk are just team rocket but without a Meowth to cancel out their natural dominance/submissive energies YES I FUCKING SAID IT)

 #anyways. the point is that they are both equally and oppositely insane. and will never ever ever be part of the same functioning workspace/office ecosystem #(emphasis on FUNCTIONING) 

 #so there is no WAY either one of them came up with this and convinced the other to follow through. they just don’t have that level of competence. as i’ve said many times before: Yzma! is only! competent-passing! bc she specifically hires the Most Himbo Of Himbos to stand next to her. and Kronk is actually extremely-and-weirdly-competent. just not at anything in his Actual Job Description. so again. team rocket coded but if the narrative stopped interrupting them with a spray bottle every time Jesse tried to assert dominance"

raccoons should be encouraged. in what way precisely, i could not say. In their Pursuits, i would suppose

I once had a raccoon walk up to me, undo the Velcro pocket on the calf of my cargo pants and steal a jolly rancher before I noticed him. When I noticed him a moment later he skittered about 10 feet back and ate it while making eye contact. 30 minutes later he tried to repeat this but I had both (1) moved the jolly ranchers to higher up pocket (2) was on guard for candy thieves (3) was armed with a broom to ward off racoons 

Other knowledge: this raccoon was well known in the area and named Petty Officer Bandit. He was demoted later in the year for repeated theft to Fireman Bandit. There was another raccoon on the military base known as Petty Officer Chungus, typically spotted on the other side about a mile away."

we called a revolutionary skyscraper with an inverted facade a fucking walkie talkie what did you expect from us

christ sometimes I just wanna. steal a time machine & go back & sit down next to my 9-year-old self and just like. let them pull out their pokemon card binder & gush about their holographic gyarados or whatever. I’d just smile & ask questions about motherfukcing bulbasaur & tell my kid self that I thought they were a neat person, & someday they’d find other people who thought so too.

like i’m a grown adult who honestly finds most kids stuff boring, but. damn if i could go back & hang out with my baby self & listen to them ramble…just so they knew someone was listening. i would in a heartbeat. thinking about u kid 

lotta people reblogging the tags so:

#wouldn’t roll my eyes or check my phone or get bored or nothing. I’d just listen to that little dork & smile & encourage them & let them explain how their favorite gameboy games worked. i was the kind of kid my adult self would find annoying & uninteresting but like…most of the actual adults in my childhood felt that way too. including my dang parents. and ya know sometimes they showed it. a lot of times without realizing it. and that messes a kid up

if you don’t make an effort kids will recognize your disinterest and lack of attention. kids deserve to have caregivers who show interest and engagement, even when it’s over stuff that adults find boring. especially then maybe. your kid doesn’t have to be fun or interesting or easy or well behaved to deserve positive attention. they deserve positive attention because they are YOUR KID. if love is unconditional then DISPLAYS of LOVE and AFFECTION must also be unconditional–not something that must be earned

telling your kid that you love them is not enough. that is step one out of like a thousand. if you just tell your kid you love them but you don’t demonstrate affection and interest and patience and warmth and etcetera–your kid isn’t gonna feel loved! “I Love You” will just become a trite phrase that they regard with mistrust! bitch you gotta FOLLOW THROUGH!!!

i can’t watch movies containing naval warfare for the same reason some horse lovers can’t watch historic war movies where horses get shot

yes, i know the cannonballs aren’t real. yes, i understand the ships are only pretending to sink. and yet, I am distress

Don’t worry! The boats just turn into submarines when the sink! They don’t actually take any damage, they just travel underwater to get a snack for being such good boats!

logically i know this, but it’s still reassuring to hear someone say it out aloud

And! When they do a really really really good job they are given boat belly rubs! and an extra warm boat bath! I am glad I could be of help to reassure you my friend!

why do we praise boats like this
boats are an invasive species and danger to the ocean and all of its natural wildlife like sharks and shipwreaks

okay wow that is a MASSIVE generalization, the boat genus has evolved over thousands of years and consists of hundreds of subspecies many of which are perfectly capable of living as part of a balanced aquatic ecosystem. boats aren’t automatically evil just because *you personally* think they’re big and scary. 

@is-the-boat-video-cute your professional opinion? 

Rating: Cute! While there are invasive boat species (see: most species of yacht), most species of boat are fully acclimated to their environment!

hate how all these apocalyptic films show society breaking down the hot minute the grid goes down, with all the survivors banding off into tiny violent gangs that prey on each other.

bitch you are a member of one of the most social species in existence! it is actually insane the extent to which humans have evolved to use cooperation as our main survival tool. humans have been building and then rebuilding societies for as long as disasters have been bringing them down. an apocalypse would be fucking awful, but the survivors would end up building communities and networks and pooling resources and knowledge, because that’s what humans do. that’s what they DO!!!

This is my biggest argument against most doomsday preppers. We have then everywhere out here, they come down from the mountains like once a year to get lottery tickets and buy underwear from Walmart. 

These people think that the minute we don’t have a stock market or police or a congress, we’re going to descend into apeshit asshattery and start killing each other, so they literally hoard weapons and ammo.

Y'all, these guys can’t even purify their own water and they think they are going to survive an apocalypse alone. 

The loners are going to die. The preppers are going to die. You wanna know who isn’t going to die? The community who strategically builds a safe space which includes food, walls, medical care, and a social structure.

woke up and someone spilled vanilla extract all over my dash, so as punishment you strange little beasties are getting all the VANILLA FACTS i know:

vanilla is the 2nd most expensive spice in the world (2nd to saffron) which is why more than 99% of what we call “vanilla extract” is actually vanillin (vanilla’s dominant flavor compound) and is not extracted from real vanilla. luckily, even professionals struggle to tell the difference when it comes to things like baked goods. but there is a distinct difference in non-heat treated products like vanilla ice cream. real vanilla has a more complex, individualized flavor profile. why is vanilla so expensive? because it is a ridiculously delicate & demanding crop. complete primadonna. vanilla beans come from vanilla orchids. these crazy flowers bloom for A SINGLE DAY and have to be HAND-POLLINATED in a process that is exhausting, delicate, and requires specialist knowledge passed down over generations.  then, if you’re lucky, you get vanilla beans.  which then require months of further specialized treatment. the entire process takes about a year and can go wrong at any stage vanilla has been cultivated for over 800 years (possibly much longer). the first known cultivators are the Totonac, an indigenous people of Mexico.  the Aztecs used it as a sweetener to balance out the bitter taste of cocoa. it was popular in a drink called xocolatl–the precursor to modern hot chocolate! it is only pollinated by a very specific orchid bee!!!  which is why no fruit could be grown outside of Mexico until the 1800s Edmond Albius, born into slavery, invented the pollination method we still use today–launching a global industry when he was just 12 years old. today, the majority of the world’s vanilla is grown in Madagascar if you want real vanilla, read the labels carefully–it’s harder to find than you think!  in conclusion, those tiny black specks you see in fancy vanilla ice cream? those are vanilla bean seeds! itty bitty orchid seeds!!! they are delicious and also a PRISSY BITCH!

(src)

Okay, but what about Saffron? Why is that more expensive?

ok i love saffron but it is a fucking CUNT look at this shit:

this is saffron. it’s made up of tiny red threads. each of those threads?

THREE TO A FUCKING FLOWER.  it takes 75,000 flowers to make ONE POUND of saffron  do u see this field? do u see this fucking field? 
  this field will produce enough saffron to fit in a goddam…baggie? a basket? a smallish bucket, perhaps? and did I MENTION  the harvesting has to be done BY HAND are u are u comprehending  the Bullshit, are u comprehending it yet? can u imagine. having to sit over a pile of thousands of blossoms and pick each. motherfucking. thread. by hand.  and after hours and hours  (your joints aching)  (your fingers stained)  after hours of this nonsense, lo and behold! you have harvested–about a thimble full of fucking saffron jesus wept and so should you  she’s such a whore why do i love her"

i think it would be funny if people occasionally arose from the dead. like if that was a real-life one-in-a-million but well-documented Thing That Sometimes Happens, and the entire legal system around death (laws on inheritance & marriage & murder etc) had to include caveats for the unlikely-but-scientifically-possible event that the dead person in question might spontaneously self-resurrect, even years or decades after death. it would raise so many inconvenient and absurd possibilities 

#imagine the legal system in that timeline. property laws and inheritance laws and bigamy laws–what happens if your spouse resurrects 10 years after they die? think how AWKWARD that would be. what happens if you inherit from someone who comes back, do you have to give the inheritance back? what if u used it to buy stuff? does the jetski u bought with the money your grandpa left u 15 years ago in college now belong to grandpa? or is there a statute of limitations?

#if the guy you got convicted of murdering returns from the dead does your conviction get changed from murder to grievous harm? how is the grievousness of the harm measured? in the number of years the guy spent as a corpse? what if you spend 20 years in prison and the victim comes back to life and it turns out grievous harm would have landed you only 5ish years. do you get reimbursed for the extra 15 years u spent in prison? 

#what is the legal process for proving you have come back to life? what are the minimum legal requirements for establishing a revenant’s identity #does it become regulation to make fingerprint/dental records of every single person who dies just on the off chance one of them comes back? #what happens if it’s someone from like 300 years ago?the world has changed and everyone they know is dead. is there a social services department that can help with that?

good evening tumblr! for the low low price of $4.20 i will give you a fact that will ruin your night!

this was not my fact, and i am livid that it actually does make sense from an evolutionary standpoint (as it makes other male llamas sterile thus reducing competition). congratulations tumblr you have successfully ruined MY night 

the fact i was GOING to share, interestingly enough, also has to do with animal genitalia:

here is a photo of a blue whale penis mounted on a plaque, have a nice evening ♥ 

#for $6.66 i will give you one awful Premium fact that is directly related to the whale penis fact but is actually so much worse

pleasure doing business with ya. your fact is: the above photo was taking at the Icelandic Phallological Museum aka the

***MUSEUM OF PENISES***

which houses the world’s largest display of penises (most of them non-human). yes this is a real place that exists, and is a popular tourist destination. and yes, many of the…exhibits have been mounted on plaques, for reasons best left unexplored

oh! here is a non-dehydrated blue whale. fun fact: the first photo was “just the tip!”

#and for one final payment of $6.66 i will give you ONE LAST BUT BY FAR THE MOST HORRENDOUS FACT about blue whale penises#much worse than the fact that a penis museum exists and has multiple whale penises on display

and here is your final Awful and Horrendous Whale Penis Fact:

whale penises were probably mistaken for sea monsters nope, i’m not kidding. wish i was. whale penises do indeed very much resemble giant monstrous tentacles when spotted in the wild. at least some “sea monsters” sightings were probably just…whale boners. which i hate. i hate that so much. 

and because today wasn’t bad enough: here is a sperm whale penis!

and HERE is a photo of a man holding a $6,000 5-and-a-half foot stuffed version!

hope you enjoyed this post! i didn’t!!!!

Can we roll it back to the dick museum…

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MOST THAT’S the part you focus on? Seriously?????

please I’m so tired

To answer the reblog about human penises

They are still looking

aren’t we all, metaphorically in life, looking for a younger and a bigger and a better one though

what. what what WHAT:

#most macho bitch boys clearly have never been in a real survival scenerio #bc i used to bus around the USA a lot, and one time the snow was coming in SUPER hard and our driver was swerving on the ice and we went off road, and we ended up stuck there. and using the radio the driver communicated with the bus stations and they said they’d send another bus - but it may be a while. but MAN it was SO fast that people were divvying things up, ppl were unpacking their bags for blankets and passing out extra sweaters that would fit other, pulling out blankets and using our duffles as pillows. 

 a good group of ppl knew no english at all - mostly being mexican immigrants - but we quickly developed a lingo of pointing and charades-and it turned out they had LOADS of snacks so we all passed those around for a while. 

 there was a woman with a small child and we all took turns watching the kid so she could sleep as we went into hour 10+ of being on this bus. keeping the baby warm and fed from her bottle etc etc.

 by the time the second bus came in to pick us all up we were a full community. it was beautiful. scary and cold as hell. but beautiful"

honestly even the highest concept sci-fi seems tame once you learn BioSteel™ Goats exist irl

What the fuck are you talking about 

you know. the spider goats. the goats spliced with spider genes. 

they shoot bulletproof webbing out of their udders!

ok ok that last part’s not technically true, but the truth is still pretty nifty:

yes these goats really exist! in most ways they are normal goats, except for how they secrete spider silk in their milk (or rather, they secrete a special protein in their milk, which is then extracted and woven into silk fibers) their DNA contains transplanted genes taken from the Golden Orb Weaver Spider, whose silk is incredibly strong–but can’t be naturally produced in large quantities. because…spiders are tiny ya’ll.  these superpowered web-slinging spidergoats genetically modified but otherwise normal and healthy goats can produce much larger amounts of this material (marketed as BioSteel), which is stronger than steel and more bulletproof than kevlar. plus it’s lightweight, elastic, and bio-compatible (compatible with living tissue), meaning it has a ton of potential industrial and medical applications.  (imagine 40 years from now you need knee surgery, and your doctor sits you down and explains that your shiny new anterior cruciate ligament was actually artificially woven out of SPIDER GOAT MILK SILK. also in this magical hypothetical future we have universal healthcare. and the wealth of all billionaires has been globally redistributed. this is my hypothetical scenario, i do what i want.) like i said. pretty nifty! and here is a photo of one such genetically modified BioSteel™ Goat, her name is Freckles ko-fi 

May I add the fantastic glow in the dark cats. They’ve been tagged with a gene from jelly fish that causes them to glow and that can be passed down. Was used to help study how other genes were passed.

for those wondering, yes glow-in-the-dark jellyfish cats are a real thing and they are helping scientists with AIDS research

I love how this reads as if the cats are actively choosing to assist with scientific research.

i think more haunted houses should have haunted clawfoot bathtubs that move and exist as separate, distinct demonically possessed entities 

Fun fact! Haunted bathtubs are an example of coevolution with haunted houses! As houses became more elaborate, haunted water fixtures changed to match the opulence. As such, the haunted hut and its symbiotic counterpart, the haunted well, gradually changed into the more inviting haunted estate with the haunted tub now being an internal parasite instead of an external one. You are correct, more haunted houses SHOULD have haunted clawfoot bathtubs because they promote the health of the house and indicate a functional paranormal ecosystem.

this website is so utterly detached from reality i love it

I just imagined a haunted house as a full on ecosystem that needs each haunted piece in order to function as a whole. So if one spirit is exorcised then the whole system goes nuts and eventually ceases to operate. Meaning that once an exorcism takes place the entire house suddenly gets 10x worse till balance is restored.

“Listen, ma’am, we can’t just exorcise this one poltergeist, this is a load bearing poltergeist, ok? We remove this one, we may as well rip out the whole damn ectosystem.”

#velvet highbacked armchairs live at the top of the predatory chair hierarchy despite being pack poltergeists much like their haunted kitchenware counterparts #apex poltergeists such as haunted beds and chaise lounges and dining tables strongly dislike being moved

Haunted lamps flicker in alluring ways to attract mates. They typically lay only one or two bulbs at a time and guard them fiercely due to both their fragility and small numbers. A bulb eventually hatches into a spooky Halloween nightlight. This process has never been witnessed, and thus is not very well understood. The nightlights are entirely dependent on their outlets, and must still rely on the protection of their parents to survive. Only until they grow into their juvenile state, table lamps, can they leave their parents to explore their surroundings and find their first lampshade. Like hermit crabs, lamps must replace their shades periodically as they reach their adult state, the floor lamp.

Elaborate haunted carpets and bloodthirsty Persian rugs may seem like scavenging bottom feeders, and technically they are, but if stomped on or run upon they have been known to take down a full grown adult with ease.

Demonic doors are obviously capable locking/unlocking, jamming/releasing at will but their hinges only squeak when they are asleep so you only have to worry about the doors when it’s quiet. 

But Imagine: DOMESTICATED clawfoot bathtubs… running out of the bathrooms, shaking themselves off like dogs, trailing a shower fixture like a lead. Dropping soap at your feet and wagging its bathtub butt as it begs you to play fetch with it."

vanilla is the 2nd most expensive spice in the world (2nd to saffron) which is why more than 99% of what we call “vanilla extract” is actually vanillin (vanilla’s dominant flavor compound) and is not extracted from real vanilla. luckily, even professionals struggle to tell the difference when it comes to things like baked goods. but there is a distinct difference in non-heat treated products like vanilla ice cream. real vanilla has a more complex, individualized flavor profile. why is vanilla so expensive? because it is a ridiculously delicate & demanding crop. complete primadonna. vanilla beans come from vanilla orchids. these crazy flowers bloom for A SINGLE DAY and have to be HAND-POLLINATED in a process that is exhausting, delicate, and requires specialist knowledge passed down over generations.  then, if you’re lucky, you get vanilla beans.  which then require months of further specialized treatment. the entire process takes about a year and can go wrong at any stage vanilla has been cultivated for over 800 years (possibly much longer). the first known cultivators are the Totonac, an indigenous people of Mexico.  the Aztecs used it as a sweetener to balance out the bitter taste of cocoa. it was popular in a drink called xocolatl–the precursor to modern hot chocolate! it is only pollinated by a very specific orchid bee!!!  which is why no fruit could be grown outside of Mexico until the 1800s Edmond Albius, born into slavery, invented the pollination method we still use today–launching a global industry when he was just 12 years old. today, the majority of the world’s vanilla is grown in Madagascar if you want real vanilla, read the labels carefully–it’s harder to find than you think!  in conclusion, those tiny black specks you see in fancy vanilla ice cream? those are vanilla bean seeds! itty bitty orchid seeds!!! they are delicious and also a PRISSY BITCH!

i’m begging you guys to start pirating shit from streaming platforms. there are so many websites where you can stream that shit for free, here’s a quick HOW TO:

1) Search for: watch TITLE OF WORK free online

2) Scroll to the bottom of results. Click any of the “Complaint” links

3) You will be taken to a long list of links that were removed for copyright infringement. Use the ‘find’ function to search for the name of the show/movie you were originally searching for. You will get something like this (specifics removed because if you love an illegal streaming site you don’t post its url on social media)

4) each of these links is to a website where you can stream shit for free. go to the individual websites and search for your show/movie. you might have to copy-paste a few before you find exactly what you’re looking, but the whole process only takes a minute. the speed/quality is usually the same as on netflix/whatever, and they even have subtitles! (make sure to use an adblocker though, these sites are funded by annoying popups)

In conclusion, if you do this often enough you will start recognizing the most dependable websites, and you can just bookmark those instead. (note: this is completely separate from torrenting, which is also a beautiful thing but requires different software and a vpn)

you can also download the media in question (look for a “download” button built into the video window, or use a browser extension such as Video DownloadHelper.)

reiterating that you absolutely need an adblocker for these sites (to avoid malware if nothing else), and i HOPE you already have one installed bc using a (free) adblocker for daily browsing tremendously improves your internet experience!

I recommend installing uBlock Origin whenever possible (Adblock Plus is also popular). Also using Firefox, bc they’re a nonprofit that gives you privacy and lets you fight ads, while Chrome is owned by Google; they just want to mine your data and sell ads.

How To Block Ads: for Desktop, click this uBlock Origin link (works with most browsers). install, restart browser, good to go! for Android, open Firefox and go to “3 dots menu > add-ons > add-on manager > enable uBlock Origin.” (this also blocks youtube ads within firefox!). this doesn’t work on Chrome, because Chrome hates you, but there are some ad-blocking apps in the play store that will give you varying results. for iOS, it’s trickier, bc Apple also hates you. here are some recommended apps in the app store. (some of them keep premium features behind a paywall, bc again Apple hates you. but there are options.) If those aren’t enough, Firefox comes to the rescue again with the Firefox Focus browser app, which includes a powerful built-in adblocker. I can’t find specifics, but try clicking the 3 dots menu and fiddling around to customize your preferences. in conclusion: a combination of Android, Firefox, and uBlock Origin makes for the best browsing experience. But no matter what system/browser combo you use, please install at least one adblocker. you will thank yourself every damn day. it will give you a faster, safer, and much less aggravating experience as a user of the Modern Internet (derogatory)

swallowed chewing gum takes years to digest, blue veins are blue bc deoxygenated blood is blue, fossil fuels are made from dinosaurs, feeding bread to birds is fine, mice like cheese, carrots are good for your eyes, cleopatra was a sultry seductress, bulls can see the color red, corsets were uncomfortable and caused deformities, glass is a slow-moving liquid which is why old window panes are uneven at the bottom, tomato juice gets rid of skunk smells, young einstein failed math class, eating before swimming increases your risk of cramps and drowning, cracking your knuckles causes arthritis, iron maidens were used as torture devices, the earth’s core is molten rock, and basically anything at all whatsoever to do with the myth of thanksgiving

they said name ONE-

bats are blind, diamonds are made of coal, the dark side of the moon is dark, the sun is yellow, lightning doesn’t strike twice, columbus landed in the u.s., medieval europeans believed the world was flat, piranhas eat human flesh, goldfish have no long-term memory, porcupines can shoot their quills, people often swallow spiders in their sleep, wolves howl at the moon, humans only have 5 senses, sore muscles are caused by a buildup in lactic acid, and rust causes tetanus!

biggest-gaudiest-patronuses:

Imagine you are lost, flying through a black night in a vast world, blown by fierce winds and hunted by strange creatures. Wild and disorientated, you stumble into a cave, and seek sanctuary there. It is a dark, wet place, but you only have to survive until daylight. 

And then you look up, and see the stars. And you think that you are saved….

Let me tell you about

Glowworms

Glowworms are essentially a magical fantasy creature that wandered into our world by mistake. They are unlikely and unreasonable, and I am extremely fond of them for the following reasons. 

They imitate the night sky… Glowworms, which live only in caves and riverbanks in New Zealand, are the larvae of a species of gnat. As the name suggests, they are indeed wormlike while in larval form. 

They live in large colonies, clinging to cave ceilings, and oh how they glow. They glow so brightly, in fact, that at first glance it’s easy to miss all those oh-so-fine silk strands. 

Millions and millions of yards of silk, wet and sticky, dangling overhead. The fact that all this knotless netting is hidden in the dim light is no accident. It’s there for a purpose.

…in order to hunt. Glowworms are enthralling to watch, but at the end of the day they are larvae. And larvae only really have one job in life: to EAT. Unlike fireflies (which are an unrelated type of beetle) glowworms use bioluminescence not for mating but for hunting. In this way, they are more like angler fish. The light is their bait–the silk is their lure. Even at close range, their traps are quite beautiful to see, like strands of pearls or the crystals of a chandelier.

These threads are essentially fishing lines. Each worm drops its own thread…

…and waits patiently to reel in its catch…

…which it then consumes alive. 

And this is where the glowworm gets its scientific name, Arachnocampa luminosa, or more literally: glowing spider-worm. Interestingly, the light-emiting molecule responsible for the glowworm’s luminesences is called luciferen, named for the Latin lucifer, “bringer of light.”

After months of feeding, these larvae will build their cocoons, emerge as adult gnats, live just long enough to lay eggs, and so die. Gradually the eggs hatch, the night sky is reinvented, new constellations are born, and the cycle begins anew.

So remember: this world contains countless miracles of nature, but nature plays by its own dispassionately cruel rules!

When you see the stars, you know you will live. You are a frail thing in a vast world, a sailor in a storming ocean–and like a sailor, you live your life by the stars. You are a navigator, born with wings on your back, born to fly: so you fly. You lift your gaze to the sky and take flight, floating up, up to the stars. You will be home again, you will be safe again, and in the morning the world will be new.

And as you rise to meet the stars, they descend to swallow you. 

paypal / ko-fi

one last fun fact! adult glowworms (gnats) occasionally fly into the silk and are eaten by the larvae! so glowworms sometimes commit cannibalism :)

Gaud you cannot commit your day to typing this out and not showing us what the gnat looks like

fun fact I was absolutely going to but then I hit photo limit. thanks for the reminder!"

i can’t watch movies containing naval warfare for the same reason some horse lovers can’t watch historic war movies where horses get shot

yes, i know the cannonballs aren’t real. yes, i understand the ships are only pretending to sink. and yet, I am distress

Don’t worry! The boats just turn into submarines when the sink! They don’t actually take any damage, they just travel underwater to get a snack for being such good boats!

logically i know this, but it’s still reassuring to hear someone say it out aloud

And! When they do a really really really good job they are given boat belly rubs! and an extra warm boat bath! I am glad I could be of help to reassure you my friend!

why do we praise boats like this
boats are an invasive species and danger to the ocean and all of its natural wildlife like sharks and shipwreaks

okay wow that is a MASSIVE generalization, the boat genus has evolved over thousands of years and consists of hundreds of subspecies many of which are perfectly capable of living as part of a balanced aquatic ecosystem. boats aren’t automatically evil just because *you personally* think they’re big and scary. 

@is-the-boat-video-cute your professional opinion? 

Rating: Cute! While there are invasive boat species (see: most species of yacht), most species of boat are fully acclimated to their environment!

here is something blessed (baby damascus goat), something cursed (adult damascus goat), and my ko-fi!

Gaud, I think you’re a little wrong. Both of these are very very blessed

blessed

blessed goat child

What i hate about them is I’m going to get school, and next semester we’re learning about them…for an entire month…not goats and they’re a breed, not outliers of different species, no…this…fucking…breed…for…an…entire…month…

They look like you’re drunk grandpa who only speaks in riddles. 

I was going to ask WHAT TYPE OF SCHOOL DO YOU GO TO, but after several re-reads I realized that’s a typo and you probably (?) meant Goat School. if this is the case please please please tell us more about Goat School.

VET they meant VET SCHOOL @professionalreblogs can you update on whether they’re okay? Because that face shape looks like they might have some problems. 

Our professor bumped up our classes when we all started researching these freaks so here’s what I’ve learned

They have bad eyesight, and poor running stamina, but otherwise they’re one of the most hardy breeds and are known as the “bulldog of goats”. They are great for both milk and meat production and apparently have an easier to digest milk than other dairy animals. They also are the “grandfather” to the goat breed Qahr, which is known as the most beautiful goat breed. 

These are also apparently one of the most oldest goat breeds to survive for so long! They were originally from India before spreading to the Middle East (specifically to nomadic tribes) for being so hardy to most any climate. From their they were sent to Britan between the 1300s and 1500s where they bred like wild fire for having such good milk production as well as good meat for when they became old enough for slaughter

They also apparently don’t have any known health problems correlated to the breed, but if not milked the females can get overloaded real quick since they produce quite a lot of milk for their size (which is one of the largest goat breeds as well!) Their skull is fairly small compared to their size but nothing is said for any health problems correlating to it.

Show bucks tend to have their ears docked, which pulls attention to their large nose, which is debated to either be for water storage or to attract mates! (We haven’t gotten to there yet, but classmates are debating) they also have large horns that curve to the back, but many farmers “dehorn” animals to avoid injury.

Their tempermant is very calm and they’re even kept as pets!

THANK YOU I tried looking it up and didn’t find anything nearly as comprehensive. 

You’re telling me there is an ancient, miraculously indestructible breed of goat 

who are the ancestors of the most beautiful goats in the world and who in their own lifespans undergo a mystic transformation from fairy-like imps to eerie hag goddesses wandering around like terrible forgotten Old Gods of the fields and forest and they are also the strangely abundant source of smooth white milk with unusual properties and the bargain for them remaining in our realm is that, upon coming of age, their ears and sometimes horns are stolen away by humans, for reasons unknown and in payment for this archaic ritual, their clan has flourished, healthy and hardy, spreading far and wide throughout the lands Goat herders bargained with the fae for magic fairy goats, is what you’re telling me.

While this is all wonderful information Qahr isn’t a breed of goat but rather the name of a Damascus goat that won the prize for most beautiful goat in the world back in 2008. You can’t get a more beautiful breed of goat than this ^^

and here are some photos of the gorgeous Qahr!

…yeah, Damascus goats are the result of some kind of fae bargain. That checks out.

Even the skull is cursed."

classic vines but they’ve been reshot hollywood style. a man stands over a cliff on a stormy night, his coat billowing in the heavy wind. rain-drenched, hair whipping about his chiseled features, he turns to the camera and–in a voice hoarse with betrayal–gasps: i can’t believe you’ve done this

Midnight. The detective bursts through a locked door to see a shadowy figure perched on the windowsill. The body of the Prime Minister sprawls on the ground, hardwood floor growing steadily darker around him. The curtains fly back as a gust of wind sweeps through the study - and in the next blink, the figure is gone.

The detective rushes to the window, but there’s no trace of the fugitive. They stare out into the shadows of London, and exclaim;

“What the f*ck, Richard?”

The detective and his assistants have been on this case for a week now. His fellows and colleagues had been gathered there to find the culprit of the murderers. On a rough day with no clear evidence in the apartment, he looks on in horror to his old friend, who is raiding the freezer on top of the fridge. Jim turns to the detective and yells: “What is this, the murder weapon? Get off my DICK!”

Two weeks go by. A shootout at Tower Bridge kills the team’s eyewitness before she can give them any information, and a cabdriver who might have had information has mysteriously vanished.

After a chance encounter, the team tracks the assassin to a boarding house before they vanish through a secret door. They’re at a dead end once more - until Jim points out the building’s address.

“Didn’t the Prime Minister stay here when he was younger?”

The landlady nods. “In this very apartment, with some other chap named Richard.”

Jim’s mouth falls open. “And they were roommates.”

The sleuth gasps.

“Oh my God, they were roommates.”

The detective closes the door behind him. He tries to stay quiet, but the latch clicks shut behind him. 

The room is dark, illuminated only by the soft twilight glow that creeps in from the window. There’s a figure standing there, by the sill—backlit, so a glimpse of young round cheeks and shining eyes is all the detective sees as the boy whips around, then turns once more to silhouette.

Slowly, the detective’s eyes grow accustomed to the dim room. He can see the shape of the boy’s defensive stance, and a faint shadow outlining an outstreched arm, something grasped in a small fist. 

“What…” the detective’s breath catches, and he tries to steady himself. “What do you have there?” 

“A knife,” says the boy, the gleam of his grin, almost maniacal visible even through the murky dark. 

The detective’s heart falls through his chest. “No.”"

1) Search for: watch TITLE OF WORK free online

2) Scroll to the bottom of results. Click any of the “Complaint” links

3) You will be taken to a long list of links that were removed for copyright infringement. Use the ‘find’ function to search for the name of the show/movie you were originally searching for. You will get something like this (specifics removed because if you love an illegal streaming site you don’t post its url on social media)

4) each of these links is to a website where you can stream shit for free. go to the individual websites and search for your show/movie. you might have to copy-paste a few before you find exactly what you’re looking, but the whole process only takes a minute. the speed/quality is usually the same as on netflix/whatever, and they even have subtitles! (make sure to use an adblocker though, these sites are funded by annoying popups)

In conclusion, if you do this often enough you will start recognizing the most dependable websites, and you can just bookmark those instead. (note: this is completely separate from torrenting, which is also a beautiful thing but requires different software and a vpn)

you can also download the media in question (look for a “download” button built into the video window, or use a browser extension such as Video DownloadHelper.)

reiterating that you absolutely need an adblocker for these sites (to avoid malware if nothing else), and i HOPE you already have one installed bc using a (free) adblocker for daily browsing tremendously improves your internet experience!

I recommend installing uBlock Origin whenever possible (Adblock Plus is also popular). Also using Firefox, bc they’re a nonprofit that gives you privacy and lets you fight ads, while Chrome is owned by Google; they just want to mine your data and sell ads.

How To Block Ads: for Desktop, click this uBlock Origin link (works with most browsers). install, restart browser, good to go! for Android, open Firefox and go to “3 dots menu > add-ons > add-on manager > enable uBlock Origin.” (this also blocks youtube ads within firefox!). this doesn’t work on Chrome, because Chrome hates you, but there are some ad-blocking apps in the play store that will give you varying results. for iOS, it’s trickier, bc Apple also hates you. here are some recommended apps in the app store. (some of them keep premium features behind a paywall, bc again Apple hates you. but there are options.) If those aren’t enough, Firefox comes to the rescue again with the Firefox Focus browser app, which includes a powerful built-in adblocker. I can’t find specifics, but try clicking the 3 dots menu and fiddling around to customize your preferences. in conclusion: a combination of Android, Firefox, and uBlock Origin makes for the best browsing experience. But no matter what system/browser combo you use, please install at least one adblocker. you will thank yourself every damn day. it will give you a faster, safer, and much less aggravating experience as a user of the Modern Internet (derogatory)

i think it would be funny if people occasionally arose from the dead. like if that was a real-life one-in-a-million but well-documented Thing That Sometimes Happens, and the entire legal system around death (laws on inheritance & marriage & murder etc) had to include caveats for the unlikely-but-scientifically-possible event that the dead person in question might spontaneously self-resurrect, even years or decades after death. it would raise so many inconvenient and absurd possibilities 

#imagine the legal system in that timeline. property laws and inheritance laws and bigamy laws–what happens if your spouse resurrects 10 years after they die? think how AWKWARD that would be. what happens if you inherit from someone who comes back, do you have to give the inheritance back? what if u used it to buy stuff? does the jetski u bought with the money your grandpa left u 15 years ago in college now belong to grandpa? or is there a statute of limitations?

#if the guy you got convicted of murdering returns from the dead does your conviction get changed from murder to grievous harm? how is the grievousness of the harm measured? in the number of years the guy spent as a corpse? what if you spend 20 years in prison and the victim comes back to life and it turns out grievous harm would have landed you only 5ish years. do you get reimbursed for the extra 15 years u spent in prison? 

#what is the legal process for proving you have come back to life? what are the minimum legal requirements for establishing a revenant’s identity #does it become regulation to make fingerprint/dental records of every single person who dies just on the off chance one of them comes back? #what happens if it’s someone from like 300 years ago?the world has changed and everyone they know is dead. is there a social services department that can help with that?

#there would be a whole branch of counseling services for people who have reanimated or had a loved one reanimate. #grief 2.0 counselors

I believe there are a handful of laws kinda like this in China, due to reincarnation being a thing over there. Monks aren’t legally allowed to reincarnate without the government’s permission.

Expand on that"

I call it the “tummy hole” just to piss of my girlfriend

absolutely inspiring that you have a girlfriend

“Tummy button” was really really common with kids where I grew up.

friend your TAGS what!!!!!

#It was also hilariously used by the very very good and pure Christian couple who once came into a clinic my dad was working at. This was in the early 80s. They had “done everything right” and waited until marriage before having sex, and then immediately started trying for a family during the honeymoon (which was about 3 weeks after high school graduation). but after 3 years of marriage remained sadly childless. The doctor was getting ready to order a barrage of tests when he noticed a rash around her navel. He decided to investigate and ask about it, even though it seemed unrelated, and was horrified to learn that for three years he had been rubbing his penis on his wife’s lower abdomen until he ejaculated because according to they way things were taught in their church ‘the father to be puts his seed into his wife’s stomach to plant the baby’’ and these two had decided together that “the tummy button” just HAD to be how you did that. “What do you mean the tummy button doesn’t open into your tummy?”"

remind me to tell yall about the worm tooth theory

fuck u it’s not a competition

I lied it is absolutely a competition and I’m WINNING

this has 9 thousand notes and I just realized I completely forgot to talk about worm tooth theory

pls explain the worm tooth theory 

ok so it was the widespread belief that tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues were caused by itty bitty parasitic worms that lived in human teeth

the theory dates all the way back to the babylonian empire, where it was discussed in the cuneiform tablet, “The Legend of the Worm.” the belief persisted all the way until the 18th century (here’s a contemporary illustration from an Ottoman Turk dental book)

Tooth Worm Theory probably came from the fact that necrotic tooth pulp does, in fact, resemble worms!

Intersting, but I never want to hear the phrase “ necrotic tooth pulp” ever again

that is so optimistic of you, here is a photo of necrotic tooth pulp 😊

an atheist ghost. they refuse to move on to the afterlife on the grounds that the afterlife does not and should not exist

they only respond to ouija board summonings in order to lecture people for participating in non-evidence-based belief systems 

exorcisms dont work cause they dont believe in them.

“yeah sure I could ‘go into the light’ as you so eloquently put it, but let’s be analytical about this. worst-case scenario, the afterlife is real and I get cast into some version of Hell for being a nonbeliever. slightly better-case scenario, it’s a reincarnation-based afterlife, which means I end up having to do the whole Existence thing all over again, which frankly seems like a huge roll of the dice. enormously risky, given the low quality of life many people experience, and that’s setting aside philosophical issues of identity, e.g. without the memories and experiences that shaped me, would I even still technically exist as a version of myself I could identify? reincarnation aside, let’s bear in mind there’s no actual evidence there’s even a so-called ‘afterlife’ waiting on the other side–for all we know, my consciousness will just dissolve into nonexistence. again, huge roll of the dice. and even in the best-case scenario? wherein I somehow pass an Arbitrary Morality Test I didn’t sign up for and get accepted into some sort of magical Heaven or whatever? well. consider it from my point of view. all of a sudden I’d be a member of a strange and unfamiliar society, subject to a completely new set of rules and regulations that I probably don’t get a say in. Is ‘Heaven’ a democracy? will I still have access to free will? will I have meaningful choices regarding lifestyle and occupation? what do the holy books say about that, huh? I could be forced to spend a literal eternity worshiping a deity who has made some extremely questionable and problematic decisions regarding the universe. I’m not signing up for that! how is that any better than my current situation? listen buddy, I spent 80 years living in a capitalist hellhole before death Itself finally freed me from all the obligations and restrictions of modern existence. I don’t work, I don’t pay rent or taxes, I just wander from place to place keeping my own schedule, doing my own thing, beholden to neither laws nor peer pressure. as purgatories go, that’s a pretty sweet deal! and what guarantee do I have that any damned afterlife is going to be more tolerable than my current not-existence, huh? none! none whatsoever. skeptic? damn right I’m skeptic! not to mention this whole Heaven-and-Hell dichotomy seems extremely manipulative if not outright abusive, as moral systems go. that’s no way to parent a species! nope. just, nope. this whole religious afterlife nonsense sounds like a whole lot of unnecessary stress and risk. I’m perfectly comfortable staying right where I am, thanks ever so, so you can tell your exorcist to write that out in latin and shove it up his ass”

“the power of christ compels ME?” bitch just because YOU choose to subscribe to a oppressively christian-centric world view doesn’t mean I have to dedicate my afterlife to following the rules of your false gods. if you’re so desperate to get smoke blown up your ass i’m happy to help you shove that thurible way on up there

honestly even the highest concept sci-fi seems tame once you learn BioSteel™ Goats exist irl

What the fuck are you talking about 

you know. the spider goats. the goats spliced with spider genes. 

they shoot bulletproof webbing out of their udders!

ok ok that last part’s not technically true, but the truth is still pretty nifty:

yes these goats really exist! in most ways they are normal goats, except for how they secrete spider silk in their milk (or rather, they secrete a special protein in their milk, which is then extracted and woven into silk fibers) their DNA contains transplanted genes taken from the Golden Orb Weaver Spider, whose silk is incredibly strong–but can’t be naturally produced in large quantities. because…spiders are tiny ya’ll.  these superpowered web-slinging spidergoats genetically modified but otherwise normal and healthy goats can produce much larger amounts of this material (marketed as BioSteel), which is stronger than steel and more bulletproof than kevlar. plus it’s lightweight, elastic, and bio-compatible (compatible with living tissue), meaning it has a ton of potential industrial and medical applications.  (imagine 40 years from now you need knee surgery, and your doctor sits you down and explains that your shiny new anterior cruciate ligament was actually artificially woven out of SPIDER GOAT MILK SILK. also in this magical hypothetical future we have universal healthcare. and the wealth of all billionaires has been globally redistributed. this is my hypothetical scenario, i do what i want.) like i said. pretty nifty! and here is a photo of one such genetically modified BioSteel™ Goat, her name is Freckles ko-fi 

May I add the fantastic glow in the dark cats. They’ve been tagged with a gene from jelly fish that causes them to glow and that can be passed down. Was used to help study how other genes were passed.

for those wondering, yes glow-in-the-dark jellyfish cats are a real thing and they are helping scientists with AIDS research

I love how this reads as if the cats are actively choosing to assist with scientific research."

sometimes I forget orchids grow on trees and I’m like. oh.

They do what now?

in the wild, most orchids grow on tree bark, a fact which will never not bring me a profound sense of delight

interestingly, orchids aren’t parasites–they are just harmless squatters hanging out with their arboreal buddies. it’s a form of commensalism–one organism benefits, the other neither benefits nor is harmed. 

OK but orchids ARE parasites. They just aren’t parasites on trees. All orchids have this very bizzare lifecycle where they begin life as parasites on fungi. Here’s the rough strategy:

1. There’s a tradeoff between how much nutrients can be in a single seed and how many seeds you can make. On one end is the double coconut, the largest seed in the world weighing as much as a small child but each double coconut palm tree makes relatively few seeds per individual per season. OR. Make a fuckton of seed that individually cost very little to make. A lot of your small nonwoody plants chose this option, grasses, dandelions, any little weeds usually.

2. But there’s a limit to how far you can push this.

3. And by god orchids crossed it.

4. Orchid seeds are so fucking small they don’t have the energy stores to fucking germinate.

5. Orchid seeds are so small that they only consist of a few cells that haven’t decided who’s going to be roots or leaves yet.

6. And this is great! If you preferred habitat is in trees where the ability to disperse from one treetop to the next and find the right little spot on that tree to survive as a seedling for a few years is really hard. Lots of seed that can float on the wind and find just that spot is great for that.

7. But shit for actually, you know, being alive.

8. But orchids are crafty bastards.

9. Most plants try very hard not to be colonized by fungi, thats usually not good.

10. But orchid seeds just let fungi in.

11. And how the turn tables.

12. Because they just start eating the fungi back.

13. And this is where it gets weird.

14. Orchids are easily in the running for most diverse plant family at nearly 30,000 different species

15. And every single fucking one of them is like this.

16. And worse than that most of them are dependent on a single species of fungus to do this for them, so they produce millions of seeds just so that one might find the one right fungus.

17. And then after that anything can happen.

18. Some orchids are nice and start paying back their hosts onve they get big enough to phtotosynthesize with nice sugars.

19. Some orchids move on to as many as 30 other fungal species throughout their lives.

20. Some complete bastards keep being parasites after they are big enough to photosynthesize on their own. That’s right, a plant that can make its own food is stealing from something that lives on dead leaves.

21. Some orchids just never grow out of it, orchids have turned into permanent parasites more often than any other group of plants because they’re all parasites so becoming a full parasite is nbd.

22. And worse, most of these actually parasitize fungi that are symbiotic with forest trees that supply sugar to the fungi in return for better access to mineral nutrients, effectively making the orchids both parasites on the fungi and the trees, in a sense the whole ecosystem.

23. This leads to one more weird phenomenon. Mutant albino orchids unable to photosynthesize, of species that normally can photosynthesize, are often recorded as being able to reach maturity and flower without issue. because they just keep being parasites instead. Orchids can just. become parasites at will.

In conclusion orchids are just the weirdest fucking plants in the world. Technically all the above applies to this obscure group of ferns called the Ophioglossum family too. Same fucked up start out life as parasites and become independent (or not) later thing.

I saw a yt document about this just yesterday and it’s wild

Turns out, that on a large scale, it’s not cost effective to farm the fungi in order to farm orchids which can then be sold worldwide. So what happens is that flower producers go entirely different route - 100% sterility. Everything bleached. Seed pods washed by 70% alcohol. Seeds being grown in petri dishes. Basically, if there isn’t the fungus to provide, people do. We know to the T what exactly in what amounds orchid seeds need, so we mix that stuff with agar jelly, sprinkle seeds over all of that, then wait several months to years until those bastards start growing. The process then continues in similar fashion until plants are capable of independent life at which point those, we have figured out, are given growth promoting substances in strategic spots in order to make the plant bloom. Adding that hormone to inactive bud on the flower stem makes it grow too and so we get those beautiful branched phalaenopsys orchids which then refuse to grow more flowers for 2+ years because they are close to collapsing from a) lack of fungy support and b)being forced to produce too many flowers. Remember this the next time you get your mom another of those 12+ flowers having beauties because her previous 3 are (half) dead."

swallowed chewing gum takes years to digest, blue veins are blue bc deoxygenated blood is blue, fossil fuels are made from dinosaurs, feeding bread to birds is fine, mice like cheese, carrots are good for your eyes, cleopatra was a sultry seductress, bulls can see the color red, corsets were uncomfortable and caused deformities, glass is a slow-moving liquid which is why old window panes are uneven at the bottom, tomato juice gets rid of skunk smells, young einstein failed math class, eating before swimming increases your risk of cramps and drowning, cracking your knuckles causes arthritis, iron maidens were used as torture devices, the earth’s core is molten rock, and basically anything at all whatsoever to do with the myth of thanksgiving

they said name ONE-

bats are blind, diamonds are made of coal, the dark side of the moon is dark, the sun is yellow, lightning doesn’t strike twice, columbus landed in the u.s., medieval europeans believed the world was flat, piranhas eat human flesh, goldfish have no long-term memory, porcupines can shoot their quills, people often swallow spiders in their sleep, wolves howl at the moon, humans only have 5 senses, sore muscles are caused by a buildup in lactic acid, and rust causes tetanus!

classic vines but they’ve been reshot hollywood style. a man stands over a cliff on a stormy night, his coat billowing in the heavy wind. rain-drenched, hair whipping about his chiseled features, he turns to the camera and–in a voice hoarse with betrayal–gasps: i can’t believe you’ve done this

Midnight. The detective bursts through a locked door to see a shadowy figure perched on the windowsill. The body of the Prime Minister sprawls on the ground, hardwood floor growing steadily darker around him. The curtains fly back as a gust of wind sweeps through the study - and in the next blink, the figure is gone.

The detective rushes to the window, but there’s no trace of the fugitive. They stare out into the shadows of London, and exclaim;

“What the f*ck, Richard?”

The detective and his assistants have been on this case for a week now. His fellows and colleagues had been gathered there to find the culprit of the murderers. On a rough day with no clear evidence in the apartment, he looks on in horror to his old friend, who is raiding the freezer on top of the fridge. Jim turns to the detective and yells: “What is this, the murder weapon? Get off my DICK!”

Two weeks go by. A shootout at Tower Bridge kills the team’s eyewitness before she can give them any information, and a cabdriver who might have had information has mysteriously vanished.

After a chance encounter, the team tracks the assassin to a boarding house before they vanish through a secret door. They’re at a dead end once more - until Jim points out the building’s address.

“Didn’t the Prime Minister stay here when he was younger?”

The landlady nods. “In this very apartment, with some other chap named Richard.”

Jim’s mouth falls open. “And they were roommates.”

The sleuth gasps.

“Oh my God, they were roommates.”"

Please

ok so if the grinch and tony had a kid, it would probably be

have weird fur and an unsettling appearance (like the grinch) be orange and into sports (tony) so that child would be Gritty

I’ve never derived an iota of joy from this website and I truly don’t know why i’m still here

  I am ashamed to say that I put a lot of effort into this….

holy. fucking. STARS.
Whoops my hand slipped…. 

how have you done this…..why have you done it…..

I can’t stop

Look at the kids run! 

Happy Grinch Day, Chapter 4 of the GRINCH X TONY THE TIGER FIX-IT FIC is up!

  I couldn’t breathe when I saw these…

Parent Trap but Gritty and the Lorax try to reunite Tony & the Grinch   The Lorax has bought his new boyfriend to meet his family :)

(Canonically the lorax probably wouldnt have dated the onceler until he was old but imo young onceler is more easily recognizeable and yes i did spend time thinking about what age i should draw the onceler at LMAO)

(IMAGE DESCRIPTION)

The Lorax introducing The Onceler, his boyfriend, to his family, which consists of his parents, Tony the Tiger and The Grinch, and his sibling Gritty of hockey fame (idk jack about hockey sorry)

the exhaustion of my souls is profound and boundless. weep for me, for my sorrow has drained away even my tears

actually since sherlock holmes is in the public domain there is nothing preventing all you fanfic writers from publishing & selling. i want someone to traditionally publish a new collection of mystery stories where holmes & watson are canonically banging

#no listen. i want them to be MYSTERY stories written in the original style. same writing style, similar plots, it’s a mystery driven story very similar to the originals. BUT holmes & watson are married. and it’s just treated as a side detail. #maybe with a single smut scene thrown in just bc i think it’d be funny. i would buy a copy

Er…it’s not that simple, unfortunately. From Lubin Austermuehle, business litigation attorneys:

  While most of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories are in the public domain, ten of his stories were published in the 1920s, and while some of those stories have been entering the public domain since 2016, others remain under copyright until January 1st, 2023 [in the United States].

(In the UK, copyright on written works extends for 70 years after the author’s death. Conan Doyle died in 1930, so the British copyright expired in 2000. American copyright law is WAY more complicated.)

Also, the estate of Arthur Conan Doyle is not at all shy about suing writers and filmmakers for copyright infringement:

1) ‘Mr. Holmes’ Copyright Lawsuit Settled –Variety, Oct 9, 2015 6:38pm PT

2) Lawsuit over ‘warmer’ Sherlock depicted in Enola Holmes dismissed – the Guardian, Tue 22 Dec 2020 08.55 EST

So…unfortunately, there is something preventing all the Holmes fanfic writers from publishing and selling…at least until January 1, 2023. 

On January 2, 2023, I expect bookstores to be flooded with Holmes & Watson smut

…ok but given that a metric shit ton already exists, is there anything stopping any random editor from messaging a bunch of ao3 writers and inviting them to publish their existing stories in an anthology? this is a very good and profitable idea, listen to me i am very intelligent.

if there are any editors or publishing professionals reading this, i very much hope you will mark the date!

January 2, 2023  IT’S HERE!"

good evening tumblr! for the low low price of $4.20 i will give you a fact that will ruin your night!

this was not my fact, and i am livid that it actually does make sense from an evolutionary standpoint (as it makes other male llamas sterile thus reducing competition). congratulations tumblr you have successfully ruined MY night 

the fact i was GOING to share, interestingly enough, also has to do with animal genitalia:

here is a photo of a blue whale penis mounted on a plaque, have a nice evening ♥ 

#for $6.66 i will give you one awful Premium fact that is directly related to the whale penis fact but is actually so much worse

pleasure doing business with ya. your fact is: the above photo was taking at the Icelandic Phallological Museum aka the

***MUSEUM OF PENISES***

which houses the world’s largest display of penises (most of them non-human). yes this is a real place that exists, and is a popular tourist destination. and yes, many of the…exhibits have been mounted on plaques, for reasons best left unexplored

oh! here is a non-dehydrated blue whale. fun fact: the first photo was “just the tip!”

#and for one final payment of $6.66 i will give you ONE LAST BUT BY FAR THE MOST HORRENDOUS FACT about blue whale penises#much worse than the fact that a penis museum exists and has multiple whale penises on display

and here is your final Awful and Horrendous Whale Penis Fact:

whale penises were probably mistaken for sea monsters nope, i’m not kidding. wish i was. whale penises do indeed very much resemble giant monstrous tentacles when spotted in the wild. at least some “sea monsters” sightings were probably just…whale boners. which i hate. i hate that so much. 

and because today wasn’t bad enough: here is a sperm whale penis!

and HERE is a photo of a man holding a $6,000 5-and-a-half foot stuffed version!

hope you enjoyed this post! i didn’t!!!!

Can we roll it back to the dick museum…

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MOST THAT’S the part you focus on? Seriously?????

please I’m so tired

aren’t we all, metaphorically in life, looking for a younger and a bigger and a better one though"
