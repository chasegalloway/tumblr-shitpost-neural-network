I‚Äôm sorry but why does that look like my almost dead 60+ year old uncle who abused my mom and her sister when they were growing up üíÄ

How the fuck should I know

What does ‚Äúcaked up‚Äù mean
Before meeting my girlfriend I never would‚Äôve shared any of my food ever, because fuck you, you know? But I was eating this fancy chex mix and they have these tasty brown bits and they‚Äôre my favorite, and I never would‚Äôve shared those tasty little morsels beforehand, but getting to share it with her was somehow even better than outright eating it. So the moral of the story isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù because I would never EVER share my perfect tasty morsels with a fucking stranger, the moral of the story is to be a muscled stud and have a perfect chex mix-type girlfriend.

Doctor: $140,000 a year

Furry artist on Patreon: $160,000 a year 

i think you‚Äôre lowballing the furry art amount tbh

I‚Äôm sorry for the inaccuracies, Doctor Yiff

no matter how I respond to this I don‚Äôt look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor‚Äôs like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went ‚Äúthat sounds like crohn‚Äôs‚Äù after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can‚Äôt go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

You could if you weren‚Äôt a fucking coward

no matter how I respond to this I don‚Äôt look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor‚Äôs like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went ‚Äúthat sounds like crohn‚Äôs‚Äù after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can‚Äôt go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

You could if you weren‚Äôt a fucking coward

I think you may also be underestimating the overlap between doctors and furries.

Hrmm I guess you could say I‚Äôm an elite knight of the old order who swore to protect the Queen from any threat that may ail her. I guess you could say I grew closer and closer to her over time until one fateful night she perished due to unknown illness. I GUESS you could say I was driven by the guilt of being unable to protect her and swore never to leave her side, even if that meant standing-guard in front her tombstone for the rest of time. I GUESS you could say that after decades of loneliness, I was driven mad, lost all sense-of-self and became an empty husk of what I once was. I guess you could say some dark-being took residence inside my now-empty husk of armor, keeping me alive for centuries past my normal lifespan. I guess you could say I became the scourge of the royal graveyard, and over time the dark curse that kept me alive spread into every standing-wall of the palace and slowly corrupted the entire town. I guess you could say my pride drove me into a spiraling pit of madness that poisoned the very land around me. I GUESS you could say that the spirit that kept me alive was the queen herself, unable to move-on from the mortal world due to my ungodly-drive to serve her past her natural life.

‚ÄúThe lofi effect‚Äù is a term I made up 20 seconds ago that dictates that a general loss of quality by means of playing a song through a bad speaker, playing in an untreated room, bit-depth & sample-rate reduction, bad mixing, purposeful or non-purposeful obfuscation of a clean mix via any and all methods, background noise, etc, yields to an effect where a person psychologically ‚Äúfills-in the gaps‚Äù in regards to the obfuscated element‚Äôs melody, rhythm, motif and tonality. depending on the severity and reduction of a clear mix via any and all prior methods allows for blank spaces to be musically-filled-in based on one‚Äôs personal preference to music, making the song more favorable. This effect is best perceived when it‚Äôs a song you‚Äôve never heard before - but there are chances that a song is perceived - based on the obfuscation of a clean mix - as even better than when you heard it last, as both the qualities you liked about the song and the aspects that you filled in via the obfuscation of sound creates an idealized end-result.

As some of you may know, my poor little boy was taken DOWN by the P*kemon company for being too similar to a certain somebody I‚Äôve never even heard of before. hah.. but that‚Äôs besides the point. There‚Äôs still a huge amount of demand for these boys, so I‚Äôve been working on fixing and adding cute little details, everyone loves it!! 

There‚Äôs been demand for the EAT THE RICH shirts to come back, I‚Äôve also been asked many times in the past to make a dark variant, this was hard but I managed to make an incredibly sexy article of clothing, on sale for the Holidays will be THREE variants, I am losing my god-damned mind.

History is written by the victors but not if you‚Äôre a sneaky loser 

This is actually remarkably true. For instance, the Norse/Vikings are universally regarded by contemporary, predominantly Christian, sources as a violent, evil, and barbaric force of soulless pagans. Which is of course not true, in many ways the Norse cultures were more socially progressive, forward thinking, and advanced than their early medieval counterparts. But since they didn‚Äôt write down a whole lot themselves, the Christians, who got their asses handed to them on a regular basis by Vikings, got to write the history about them instead. And they were quite negative about the Norsemen for a number of reasons. For instance, in one English Christian source, which reads like it was written by an incel, there is the argument that the English must slay the Norse(Danes) quickly, because they wash several times a week, use oils in their hair that smells good, and actually bathe more than once per year, thus seducing all the English women. This, to me, reeks of a group of losers sneakily trying to justify their hate and rage towards a different culture who are, by the standards of the age, somewhat less shitty than the sneaky losers.

 

In conclusion, you‚Äôre 100% correct Pukicho, history is written by both the victors, but also by the sneaky losers.

My favourite example of winners not writing history is the Sea Peoples of the Bronze Age Collapse. Some randos rolled up and absolutely rocked Egypt‚Äôs shit and yet their identity is a ridiculously massive mystery

My least favourite example is the influence that memoirs written by German officers had on the public perception of ww2 because it pretty directly contributed to modern wheraboos.

Can you two stop being cooler than me on my own post?

Now hear me out, do you think maybe Jesus was just standing in a really small boat

in physics i learned that in order to float on the surface of a fluid, an object must displace an amount of water equal to its own weight. 

So a boat small enough to hold him up would also not move very much water out of the way, and would maybe have to have negative weight to balance out the weight of Jesus

UNLESS 

Jesus himself simply had an extremely low density and did not weigh much at all

(this would make him lighter than Legolas)

Whatever you said, I think he was balancing on two boogie boards.

Yeah its pretty cool, there‚Äôs no individuality since we‚Äôre all one, but we‚Äôre in a constant state of euphoria so it‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs like your body is being submerged in an ocean of water that‚Äôs no hotter nor colder than yourself, and so you feel like you‚Äôre floating in nothingness, yet being wrapped in a comforting blanket of consciousness flow.

FUCK ART CLASS when I was a teen in Taiwan at this private school the dopey ass stupid ass art teacher asked everyone to draw these HUGE self-portraits for a final project. Does this oaf know so little of the human psyche that he would so callously expose students to such deep self-reflection? Does he not know the harm it could do? as I drafted the canvas with charcoal, deep-seeded blacks reigned an inescapable morose feeling to the portrait from the very beginning, to stare at myself and interpret what I should draw, a torturous affair that ended in a blacker, sadder reflection of my own soul, of my imperfections, my asymmetry. I felt as though my peers could see the true me, my horrible antithesis to self. Oh, the horror of this affair. What I wouldn‚Äôt do to strap this teacher to a chair against a mirror in some dark dark room, and simply let him stare at himself for eternity, as the shadows warp his face to that of a horrible unloved monster.

  Back when I was in seventh grade, I took mixed martial arts classes, I was aggressive and rambunctious and it was a great outlet. I learned how to take down someone by bending their wrist a certain way. Anyways, I used that power on a kid I didn‚Äôt like cause he had the same name as me. I felt like God, and I never learned any lesson. The end. 

What happened to the kid?

Please don‚Äôt make me read 3 paragraphs of marvel meta-analysis

‚Ä¶. Anyways captain marvel cannot pee, she doesn‚Äôt need to pee, she is incapable of peeing (on earth anyways). In the film you can clearly see that she never pees, not once. Despite this, in endgame, she clearly states ‚Äúgotta pee‚Äù to Thor during the stark squabble - she then leaves the planet in order to pee, not returning until the very end of the movie, to take down Thanos‚Äô bus.

Does this mean she had to leave our planet in order to pee? Or was it more a factor of privacy? Unfortunately, the Russo brothers refuse to make a clear statement where captain marvel was during this time, or what she was doing. I suspect she was residing in her condo, peeing the whole time, as she held it in for the rest of the movie. 

Upon returning to earth, she seems far stronger than she was prior to the long break - could this be a factor of her pee holding her abilities back? Or was this merely coincidence? Frankly, we do not know, we may never know until Marvel gets it together.
Hey there fella‚Äôs - I‚Äôve been sent many hundreds of asks inquiring what I use for my music! So I thought I‚Äôd compile a list of helpful resources and my favorite tools that I use for my production -

Now the amount I own is overkill. I‚Äôm an enthusiast and I‚Äôve spent the past 11 years building up my repertoire of tools and instruments and a bunch of fun stuff to play around with - but you really only need one synth, one workstation, a few effects and sounds to get started making your own music! 

1. DAW (Digital Audio Workstation!) 

I use FL studio the most, it‚Äôs easy for beginners to pick up yet has a decently in-depth feature set! I use it more than any other DAW thanks to its ease of use and great piano roll !! (10/10) Cubase is the second DAW I own, it‚Äôs highly advanced, great for building huge orchestral templates due to a useful folder-system and plug-in on and off switch that hugely saves on CPU performance when working with huge sample sizes! But registering and setting up the DAW is a huge bitch due to their licensing shenanigans (8/10) Pro Tools is the professional standard for most Hollywood studios, it‚Äôs complex and GREAT for mixing live tracks, but it doesn‚Äôt have the same streamlined convenience the other two have (7/10) (I don‚Äôt own Ableton but I‚Äôve heard great things, it‚Äôs a bit on the pricier end for the same performance you can get in FL studio for less, so I never bought it) 2. Virtual Synths!

I‚Äôll list my favorite synths in order from most used to least used!

Omnisphere is the synth I use the most, it‚Äôs a hybrid synth that uses thousands of samples and waveforms to generate very unique and complex sounds - it has a huge number of presets, and might be the most impressive virtual synth in the market, honestly, it‚Äôs so good, if you could afford the hefty $500 price tag, you won‚Äôt need any other synth I suggest to you on this list - that‚Äôs how comprehensive it is.  Serum is the Internets favorite bog-standard wavetable synthesizer, it‚Äôs great for a variety of sounds, but most comfortably works with heavy bass and EDM - it has a very clean sound, it has a nice list of effects and it‚Äôs only $189 U-HE Diva is a synth that emulates older, more vintage synths from the good ol days, it sounds phenomenal and works great in more chill genres, or, of course, outrun and 80s - it‚Äôs not too pricey at $200 but it‚Äôs very CPU intensive  Massive X is the resurgence of one of the most popular soft synths of the early 2010s that came out last month - I haven‚Äôt played with it, really, but I‚Äôve heard good things, definitely not a bad choice if you plan on buying the Native instruments Komplete bundle, which is a great deal!  There are hundreds of synths out there, some very good ones I didn‚Äôt mention, however, these are the ones I use, and they‚Äôll keep you preoccupied for a very long time. 

3. Effects

An equally important aspect for producing music is having effects and mixing and mastering plug-ins to louden your music, make it cleaner and crisper, or all around more interesting! The great thing about DAW‚Äôs like Pro tools, Ableton, and Cubase, is that they offer most of these effects included with the DAW - FL studio has a less comprehensive number of built-in effects, but thanks to this, is much cheaper - and frankly, sooner or later, you‚Äôre going to want to change the factory plug-ins for more professional 3rd party ones!

I use the ozone 8 and neutron 3 to mix and master my tracks, from Izotope!! Waves products is a good cheaper alternative and they often have sales! 

for reverbs (think of that cool echo effect you hear sometimes on voices) - I use vss3 and valhalla room - oftentimes, synths will come included with their own built in effects and reverbs, serum and omnisphere have great ones.

There are dozens more effects I didn‚Äôt get into in this list, but the learning process is quite high, so be sure to understand what saturation is, or a compressor, equalizers, Flanger, Phaser, Delays, LFO‚Äôs, and more! 

4. Hardware I use! 

So once you get used to the wonderful world of synthesis, or maybe you‚Äôre a pianist and want something physical right off the bat, you can get into hardware! It is very useful to buy yourself a MIDI piano if you plan on using a digital audio workstation! 

Just a warning! If you‚Äôre new, I‚Äôd suggest you don‚Äôt pick up these mutli-thousand dollar synths, I‚Äôd suggest checking out some cheaper synths by Korg or Roland, that may not offer as many features as the ones I‚Äôm about list, but will be good regardless, and will help you understand the world of synthesis. 

OP-1 - $1200 This is an incredibly unique piece of hardware, you could almost consider it a small physical, portable DAW! It‚Äôs so much fun to use and it‚Äôs great for getting ideas, its not nearly as comprehensive as a real DAW, however, and is limited by its own software! Moog Matriarch - $2000 this synth isn‚Äôt technically out yet, but it is the upgraded version to the Moog grandmother (which I own), which is a less powerful, smaller version of the upcoming matriarch! This synth oozes analog - if you plan on learning synths, you must learn the difference between analog gear and digital gear - but the matriarch and grandmother makes AMAZING use of its physical analog hardware, and offers you super rich, fat, complex tones, filters, and oscillators!  Prophet Rev 2 - $2000 This is one of my favorite analog synths I‚Äôve ever owned, it has 16 voices, which means 16 notes can be played at a time (2 oscillators per note) - unlike the matriarch and grandmother, which can only play 4 or 1 note respectively - this one focuses on making the oscillators and filters less complex, but in turn, allowing a greater number of notes! That doesn‚Äôt mean it sounds worse, however, it just means the performance was allocated some place else - this synth sounds beautiful, and I use it often for huge pads and chords! (the moog is great for leads and bass!) Focusrite 2i4 - $169 This is a relatively cheap and popular audio interface that‚Äôs use to allow cleaner, faster and better playback! If you get into production, you‚Äôll need an audio interface! It‚Äôs honestly, just good to have in general!  Desk I use is Platform by Output - $800 Speakers I use are the bower and wilkins 606 - $900 (I suggest rokit 5s to start) - must have amplifier for the wilkins (I use the emotiva Basx A-150) I have two really cool pedals, both by chasebliss audio, one called MOOD and the other called Warped Vinyl hi-fi - they both have a variety of uses, so please refer to their features on the site, these really are only useful if you have a lot of external gear! Both $349 I put all of my physical hardware through a Mackie ProFX 8v2 - A cheap and relatively compact mixer, directly into my audio interface!  I own a few hi-fi headphones (the ibasso sr1 and the Audeze LCD-X) but you really only need a good pair of studio headphones to get started, especially if you don‚Äôt want to deal with the expensive hassle of speakers right away! Check out audio technica and sennheiser for some great cheaper alternatives!  

Okay anyways! despite how long and intense this list may seem, this really isn‚Äôt everything I own, but it‚Äôs a good list of tools I most enjoy using, and tools I think can add a great deal of production value to your music !!! I‚Äôll update this list as new things are added!!! 

I hope this helped! Remember, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with starting off much smaller!

Hey do u know that one song that‚Äôs in every trailer that goes ‚ÄúFOR YOUUUU, FOR YOOUUU, OOO OOO OOOO O O OOO OO OO OOOOOO‚Äù ?????

Yeah that‚Äôs song is the embodiment mass extinction 

That song is the worst thing that‚Äôs ever been created. The solar debris that formed our earth 4.5 billion years ago was wasted on us because this song was one of its byproducts - we were better off a magma-ridden, lifeless planet than have this song be a thing that exists in this universe. I would erase this song from memory if it meant I had to live forever, see all my loved ones perish, watch the world burn and float ceaselessly in space for eternity ‚Äî as long as that eternity was spent not having to know this fucking corporate cum-bucket of a song exists, I‚Äôd be chill. 

well now i have to listen to it

No you don‚Äôt. The song isn‚Äôt particularly bad, nor is it particularly good, it sits so delicately in-between being these two things that it becomes practically nothing - - - a purgatorial essence - a sad and quiet middle-ground. You would rather be known for being horrible than be nothing at all. 

for christ‚Äôs sake, just say it‚Äôs been stuck on a loop in your head for a week and go

Don‚Äôt assume this song has been stuck in my head, fool. Whenever I get a shitty song stuck in my head I simply think of ‚ÄúScatmans World‚Äù to purge my mind-space of unfavorable thought. Works every time.

 So I‚Äôm watching this anime that has this scientist/doctor-type character who‚Äôs supposed to be really smart and cool - whatever. Anyways for some reason, the person who designed this character thought we‚Äôd forget that he‚Äôs a man of science or somethin, cause they stapled the theory of relativity right on to his left shoulder for no reason??? 

That‚Äôs fucking stupid, why did you do that? He‚Äôs a doctor, not a physicist‚Ä¶ what the fuck is wrong with you. 

He himself wrote that on his clothes. It‚Äôs to make him remember there is hope. Read the manga.

e=mc¬≤ ‚â† Hope 

Maybe that‚Äôs the wrong word, what he said was ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget..no matter how much this petrification seems like fantasy, a scientific foundation is the one thing that will never falter!!‚Äù which basically motivates him to continue trying to save every human in this stone world.

Okay okay fair enough, that‚Äôs a decent reason. But I‚Äôll still probably only think of this as the Jared Leto ‚ÄúDamaged‚Äù forehead tattoo anime-equivalent

I swear every teen who‚Äôs slightly into music goes through the fucking superiority complex shit where they think THEIR music and what they listen to is the best and everything else is BAD because it‚Äôs popular or modern music is ‚Äòtrash‚Äô or something like that. 

Lemme just say, as someone who‚Äôs been messing with music for over a decade, that if you think this way: you‚Äôre dumb as shit, your opinions are bad, and you gotta grow up chief. Modern music isn‚Äôt getting worse, your enjoyment in music isn‚Äôt any more valid than anyone else‚Äôs, music doesn‚Äôt need gatekeeping. And your psuedo-intellect is very silly to everyone else besides yourself.

There are two ways companies personify themselves. One way is pretty natural and fine and the other is stupid. Nintendo personified itself because their product and services built personality for their company, cause everyone loves a little mario and pokemon!! Then u have a burger company with no definable features compared to any other burger company, and so they get some intern to run a twitter and be unnecessarily sassy for crowd appeal and it just feels weird man. I still find it weird. Nintendo doesn‚Äôt need to sass their twitter followers to be enjoyed by people.

You mean some team of marketing executives. No relatable human intern is behind these accounts.

U know what? You‚Äôre absolutely right, they want you to assume it‚Äôs some intern, but with this shit you have to assume the worst, because they won‚Äôt tell you who runs it regardless. Its probably a team of focus-tested businessmen and it fucking sucks.

That is not the dream! I‚Äôm divorced twice, no kids and living with my girlfriend who has two kids. It blows! I‚Äôm two weeks away from attaining my Splunk accredited Consultant certification so I can go on the road 75% of the year and make $125k+. That‚Äôs my dream.

  People being good at art and shit. Who do you think you are?

Artist

FUCK 

YOU

Look, I know I‚Äôm not an NSFW blog, or am in any way affiliated with NSFW shit, but many people dabble in both on here, there are those who built a community based around something intrinsically lewd - - that doesn‚Äôt make it any less valid or significant. Tumblr states on their twitter bio: ‚Äúwhere your interests connect with your people‚Äù ‚Äì but that‚Äôs absolute bullshit when you ban something as normalized and okay as nudity and lewd art.

NSFW artists are still artists trying to make due, NSFW photographers, amateur or not, still should have a platform to share their stuff with a community. 

Tumblr thinks that everything will become perfect and idealized once they remove the NSFW aspects from their site, but that‚Äôs not how forcibly removing content works ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt work, it pisses people off, it waters down the content on your site, and it destroys your already fragile reputation.

Tumblr never fucking listens, they refuse to listen, regardless of how much shit this site goes through, how much negativity it acquires, they make the worst decisions or no decision at all. They need to fucking learn, or they‚Äôll lose something of value to many on here. They need to rethink their actions, and fast.

I‚Äôll still be here, but catch me on twitter too. I now know the importance of expanding your following to more than one website.

People are always like ‚Äúthis fandom sucks‚Äù and ‚Äúthat fandom sucks‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs the truth about 99% of fandoms: once they‚Äôre popular enough to be unavoidable, they‚Äôre intrinsically ass. There is truth in that some fandoms are worse than others, for example, bronies are the lowest common denominator, as they attract a certain cesspool of people, but no matter how innocent the thing you‚Äôre fangirling over is, sooner or later, some asshole will come to ruin the peaceful state of your fandom, and it‚Äôll bring other assholes, then your fandom is suddenly 1 million large and you‚Äôre within a sea of like-minded but different assholes, all with your own vision as to what this perfect fandom-utopia should act like. Suddenly, you‚Äôre a volunteering subject in some internet social experiment, a wave crashing abruptly and chaotically along the shores of the vast web. Unyielding and obnoxious to all onlookers.

U know idk why Rockstar had to make red dead 2 so scary. I‚Äôm almost certain half the length of the games production time was spent filling this game with scary shit. 

I don‚Äôt know why in my western action game I can stumble across a ghost woman staring at me from a second story window, a man hiding behind me in a mirror, whispers in the forest, two UFOs, Sasquatch, the literal rake, cannibals, a man who calls himself the devil hiding in a secret cave at the edge of the map, deformed bone creatures, glowing pentagrams, strange carvings, witches and serial killers, but you do you Rockstraar.

  One time I was laying in bed at 2am eating some tasty ass raisins, and I was living life to the fullest. It was great, but somehow, a raisin managed not only to miss my mouth, but land somewhere on top of my head or something, because 30 minutes into hanging out in my bed eating raisins like a king, the rogue raisin fell out of my hair and onto my chest, and I straight up thought it was a beetle or a fucking spider, so I flipped the fuck out and the head-raisin bounced somewhere outta sight, and I spent that whole night, like 2 hours, just tearing apart my bed trying to find a bug, because I thought the head raisin was a fucking beetle.

Are you okay?

Doctor: $140,000 a year

Furry artist on Patreon: $160,000 a year 

i think you‚Äôre lowballing the furry art amount tbh

I‚Äôm sorry for the inaccuracies, Doctor Yiff

no matter how I respond to this I don‚Äôt look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor‚Äôs like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went ‚Äúthat sounds like crohn‚Äôs‚Äù after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can‚Äôt go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

john ‚Äòsmokes that‚Äô green

we get it

i dont think you do. john green is a famous young adult author, known for works such as The Fault in Our Stars and Looking For Alaska. hes also an awkward middle aged man who feels threatened by childrens post ironic internet humor. hes a very uncool nerd, the kind that i shove in lockers. ‚Äúgreen‚Äù is also a slang term for marijuana, which i smoke a lot of because im cool, but the nerdy writer man doesn‚Äôt because he is a nerd. the joke is that john green has green in his name, and if his middle name was ‚Äúsmoke that‚Äù it would be entirely paradoxical, because john green is a nerd, and doesnt smoke weed like i do (i smoke a lot of weed)

I just saw interstellar. 

So I‚Äôm gonna give you a dated review of how I feel about it:

I don‚Äôt usually care about the opinions of others when it comes to film, I doubt you guys do either. This movie intrigued me, so I‚Äôm going to talk about it anyways.

As a science-junky and a huge fan of space, obviously I noticed the apparent flaws coming from some of the scenes in this movie. But, as the film piked my interests, I gave it an open-minded shot and thoroughly enjoyed what was there.

Yes, there are apparent problems with some of the scenes when you look at it from a scientific perspective. But damn, I go to metacritic and IMDB and you have these perfectionists ripping the movie apart for flaws it could hardly avoid. Like shit, yes, Ice clouds are licensed to some artistic leniencies‚Ä¶ obviously.

These realists are telling Nolan to make the movie as scientifically accurate as it can be, down to the smallest details. Little do these scientists know that the main purpose of a triple A film is to make a profit from what‚Äôs IN the storyboard.

What pisses me off is that this film is getting one‚Äôs and zero‚Äôs for something entirely unavoidable, due to it either being not realistic enough, or, the more usual case when it comes to film reviews - the idiots who don‚Äôt get it in the first place! There‚Äôs a thin line between what makes a movie like this have a huge demographic and what makes it have none. That means sacrificing what could have made this film scientifically accurate.

This film in particular has some of the best compositions I‚Äôve ever seen. The use of space and contrast of color is gorgeous. I‚Äôm incredibly sad I missed this film in theaters just because of how this movie is visually. It‚Äôs beyond any other space film in regards to visuals.

Not to mention the score is phenomenal, having heavy focus on organs, which, surprisingly fits the tone of being in deep space. I‚Äôve never seen the organ be used for that purpose before, especially for this films tone and scope. The large chords that are able be played on such an instruments gives the soundtrack thick sound without over-complicating the score with too many other instruments.

The story gets a little bit expository near the end. There are some stretches in the film when it comes to the growth of a character, for instance, the daughter seeming to have figured out how to accomplish what she needs to do by staring at a watch and figuring out that it‚Äôs Morse code. The only flaws this film has comes from overlooking character growth.

Overall, this film deserves a Nani 9/10. If you ignore the incorrect scientific facts and minor plot slip-ups, this movie is an absolutely fantastic joy to watch. The visuals and score alone makes it an incredibly good film worth your time.

reblog this post with the oldest meme you can think of

Many believe that this is the very first true internet meme, it was even passed around on paper during its beginning years

Leetspeak (1980s)

Ben Huh, CEO Cheezburger

‚Äú1337speak,‚Äù read as leetspeak, is a corrupt style of the English language marked by liberal interchanging of numbers and symbols in place of certain letters that arose from the so-called ‚Äúleet‚Äù (‚Äúelite‚Äù) subculture of hackers in the late 1980s, and later, gamers in the 1990s.

Though now considered an outdated vernacular, 1337speak established a way to ‚Äúbe cool‚Äù on the Internet and left many other lasting legacies in the online gaming world ‚Äì most notably ‚Äún00bs.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know a lot about coding and its difficulties, but I‚Äôd imagine having to change the entire way things load on a website to be a difficult task.

The only reason why there‚Äôs no Season 1 is, they don‚Äôt have the gag reel for that season. Also, there are subtitles in Season 2 because I suck and couldn‚Äôt get rid off it for some unknown reasons. Other than that, I hope you enjoy the gag reel.

I just

dislike the idea that a ‚Äòhappy ending‚Äô is base and boring

that an ending that is depressing and angsty and full of darkness automatically makes it ‚Äúsomething more‚Äù

There‚Äôs basic reasoning as to why that‚Äôs universally considered true. Happy endings leave nothing to expand upon. It‚Äôs easy to tie things up in a tidy knot and finish things there. It takes a lot of effort to produce a setting that, even after the primary plot has been dealt with, can be expanded upon. That unknown is what drives curiosity and requires thought.

I hate when parents use the whole ‚ÄúI pay for your food and clothes and everything else!‚Äù Excuse to make their kids feel guilty.

Poor you.

Being able to find someone you click with so naturally is the best feeling ever. You feel like you‚Äôve been best friends you‚Äôre whole life, it feels like you‚Äôre coming home. You‚Äôre so comfortable with them. Maybe that‚Äôs what a soulmate is. Not someone who shares every single thing in common with you, but someone who feels like home.

Me: ‚ÄúHi! How are you?‚Äù Customer #2: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, thanks.‚Äù (Clearly she is not ok, but she is trying very hard to be pleasant. She is getting very basic items: milk, bread, eggs, etc. Nothing very festive.) Me: ‚ÄúSo your total comes out to $0.00.‚Äù Customer: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúThe person before you gave me a $150 gift card to use for the next person I thought could use it. You look like you‚Äôre having a rough day, so here are your groceries, and there‚Äôs about $130 left on this card.‚Äù (The customer just started crying. Once she could, she thanked me about 100 times. Made my whole Christmas season.)
