Guys i found a decapitated stretchy alien in an old toy box. Its so gross and old, take a look. 

I’m sorry but why does that look like my almost dead 60+ year old uncle who abused my mom and her sister when they were growing up 💀

How the fuck should I know

What does “caked up” mean
Before meeting my girlfriend I never would’ve shared any of my food ever, because fuck you, you know? But I was eating this fancy chex mix and they have these tasty brown bits and they’re my favorite, and I never would’ve shared those tasty little morsels beforehand, but getting to share it with her was somehow even better than outright eating it. So the moral of the story isn’t “sharing is caring” because I would never EVER share my perfect tasty morsels with a fucking stranger, the moral of the story is to be a muscled stud and have a perfect chex mix-type girlfriend.

Doctor: $140,000 a year

Furry artist on Patreon: $160,000 a year 

i think you’re lowballing the furry art amount tbh

I’m sorry for the inaccuracies, Doctor Yiff

no matter how I respond to this I don’t look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor’s like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went “that sounds like crohn’s” after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can’t go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

You could if you weren’t a fucking coward

Puki, i hate to tell you, but some of the strongest shapes in nature are based off of triangles, so if we were to follow that route, it would be four sided pryamids and hexagons and the like. Orbs and circles aren’t space efficient.

A few rattles forward, you see him: the towering figure, some 8 thousand feet tall at the very least, staring down at you sympathetically. The Milk Giver. You’re unsure whether to cry or smile at the sight of the shadowed beast, or God, whom offers you treats and occasionally grabs you. The large tendrils, five of them at the end of each limb, touches you delicately. Is this how The Giver communicates?

Doctor: $140,000 a year

Furry artist on Patreon: $160,000 a year 

i think you’re lowballing the furry art amount tbh

I’m sorry for the inaccuracies, Doctor Yiff

no matter how I respond to this I don’t look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor’s like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went “that sounds like crohn’s” after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can’t go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

You could if you weren’t a fucking coward

I think you may also be underestimating the overlap between doctors and furries.

Hrmm I guess you could say I’m an elite knight of the old order who swore to protect the Queen from any threat that may ail her. I guess you could say I grew closer and closer to her over time until one fateful night she perished due to unknown illness. I GUESS you could say I was driven by the guilt of being unable to protect her and swore never to leave her side, even if that meant standing-guard in front her tombstone for the rest of time. I GUESS you could say that after decades of loneliness, I was driven mad, lost all sense-of-self and became an empty husk of what I once was. I guess you could say some dark-being took residence inside my now-empty husk of armor, keeping me alive for centuries past my normal lifespan. I guess you could say I became the scourge of the royal graveyard, and over time the dark curse that kept me alive spread into every standing-wall of the palace and slowly corrupted the entire town. I guess you could say my pride drove me into a spiraling pit of madness that poisoned the very land around me. I GUESS you could say that the spirit that kept me alive was the queen herself, unable to move-on from the mortal world due to my ungodly-drive to serve her past her natural life.

“The lofi effect” is a term I made up 20 seconds ago that dictates that a general loss of quality by means of playing a song through a bad speaker, playing in an untreated room, bit-depth & sample-rate reduction, bad mixing, purposeful or non-purposeful obfuscation of a clean mix via any and all methods, background noise, etc, yields to an effect where a person psychologically “fills-in the gaps” in regards to the obfuscated element’s melody, rhythm, motif and tonality. depending on the severity and reduction of a clear mix via any and all prior methods allows for blank spaces to be musically-filled-in based on one’s personal preference to music, making the song more favorable. This effect is best perceived when it’s a song you’ve never heard before - but there are chances that a song is perceived - based on the obfuscation of a clean mix - as even better than when you heard it last, as both the qualities you liked about the song and the aspects that you filled in via the obfuscation of sound creates an idealized end-result.

History is written by the victors but not if you’re a sneaky loser 

This is actually remarkably true. For instance, the Norse/Vikings are universally regarded by contemporary, predominantly Christian, sources as a violent, evil, and barbaric force of soulless pagans. Which is of course not true, in many ways the Norse cultures were more socially progressive, forward thinking, and advanced than their early medieval counterparts. But since they didn’t write down a whole lot themselves, the Christians, who got their asses handed to them on a regular basis by Vikings, got to write the history about them instead. And they were quite negative about the Norsemen for a number of reasons. For instance, in one English Christian source, which reads like it was written by an incel, there is the argument that the English must slay the Norse(Danes) quickly, because they wash several times a week, use oils in their hair that smells good, and actually bathe more than once per year, thus seducing all the English women. This, to me, reeks of a group of losers sneakily trying to justify their hate and rage towards a different culture who are, by the standards of the age, somewhat less shitty than the sneaky losers.

 

In conclusion, you’re 100% correct Pukicho, history is written by both the victors, but also by the sneaky losers.

My favourite example of winners not writing history is the Sea Peoples of the Bronze Age Collapse. Some randos rolled up and absolutely rocked Egypt’s shit and yet their identity is a ridiculously massive mystery

My least favourite example is the influence that memoirs written by German officers had on the public perception of ww2 because it pretty directly contributed to modern wheraboos.

Can you two stop being cooler than me on my own post?

Now hear me out, do you think maybe Jesus was just standing in a really small boat

in physics i learned that in order to float on the surface of a fluid, an object must displace an amount of water equal to its own weight. 

So a boat small enough to hold him up would also not move very much water out of the way, and would maybe have to have negative weight to balance out the weight of Jesus

UNLESS 

Jesus himself simply had an extremely low density and did not weigh much at all

(this would make him lighter than Legolas)

Whatever you said, I think he was balancing on two boogie boards.

Its in perfect condition, looking for 2.6k plus shipping - Sounds insane but if you know anything about synthesis you know that’s a solid price for this, no blemishes and I still have original packaging.

FUCK ART CLASS when I was a teen in Taiwan at this private school the dopey ass stupid ass art teacher asked everyone to draw these HUGE self-portraits for a final project. Does this oaf know so little of the human psyche that he would so callously expose students to such deep self-reflection? Does he not know the harm it could do? as I drafted the canvas with charcoal, deep-seeded blacks reigned an inescapable morose feeling to the portrait from the very beginning, to stare at myself and interpret what I should draw, a torturous affair that ended in a blacker, sadder reflection of my own soul, of my imperfections, my asymmetry. I felt as though my peers could see the true me, my horrible antithesis to self. Oh, the horror of this affair. What I wouldn’t do to strap this teacher to a chair against a mirror in some dark dark room, and simply let him stare at himself for eternity, as the shadows warp his face to that of a horrible unloved monster.

Yeah its pretty cool, there’s no individuality since we’re all one, but we’re in a constant state of euphoria so it’s alright. It’s like your body is being submerged in an ocean of water that’s no hotter nor colder than yourself, and so you feel like you’re floating in nothingness, yet being wrapped in a comforting blanket of consciousness flow. Anyways bye.

Also if one person gets a nightmare, we all get nightmares, which is less good, but it’s fine since sleep doesn’t exist so much.

  FUCK ART CLASS when I was a teen in Taiwan at this private school the dopey ass stupid ass art teacher asked everyone to draw these HUGE self-portraits for a final project. Does this oaf know so little of the human psyche that he would so callously expose students to such deep self-reflection? Does he not know the harm it could do? as I drafted the canvas with charcoal, deep-seeded blacks reigned an inescapable morose feeling to the portrait from the very beginning, to stare at myself and interpret what I should draw, a torturous affair that ended in a blacker, sadder reflection of my own soul, of my imperfections, my asymmetry. I felt as though my peers could see the true me, my horrible antithesis to self. Oh, the horror of this affair. What I wouldn’t do to strap this teacher to a chair against a mirror in some dark dark room, and simply let him stare at himself for eternity, as the shadows warp his face to that of a horrible unloved monster.

Please don’t make me read 3 paragraphs of marvel meta-analysis

…. Anyways captain marvel cannot pee, she doesn’t need to pee, she is incapable of peeing (on earth anyways). In the film you can clearly see that she never pees, not once. Despite this, in endgame, she clearly states “gotta pee” to Thor during the stark squabble - she then leaves the planet in order to pee, not returning until the very end of the movie, to take down Thanos’ bus.

Does this mean she had to leave our planet in order to pee? Or was it more a factor of privacy? Unfortunately, the Russo brothers refuse to make a clear statement where captain marvel was during this time, or what she was doing. I suspect she was residing in her condo, peeing the whole time, as she held it in for the rest of the movie. 

Upon returning to earth, she seems far stronger than she was prior to the long break - could this be a factor of her pee holding her abilities back? Or was this merely coincidence? Frankly, we do not know, we may never know until Marvel gets it together.
Hey there fella’s - I’ve been sent many hundreds of asks inquiring what I use for my music! So I thought I’d compile a list of helpful resources and my favorite tools that I use for my production -

Now the amount I own is overkill. I’m an enthusiast and I’ve spent the past 11 years building up my repertoire of tools and instruments and a bunch of fun stuff to play around with - but you really only need one synth, one workstation, a few effects and sounds to get started making your own music! 

1. DAW (Digital Audio Workstation!) 

I use FL studio the most, it’s easy for beginners to pick up yet has a decently in-depth feature set! I use it more than any other DAW thanks to its ease of use and great piano roll !! (10/10) Cubase is the second DAW I own, it’s highly advanced, great for building huge orchestral templates due to a useful folder-system and plug-in on and off switch that hugely saves on CPU performance when working with huge sample sizes! But registering and setting up the DAW is a huge bitch due to their licensing shenanigans (8/10) Pro Tools is the professional standard for most Hollywood studios, it’s complex and GREAT for mixing live tracks, but it doesn’t have the same streamlined convenience the other two have (7/10) (I don’t own Ableton but I’ve heard great things, it’s a bit on the pricier end for the same performance you can get in FL studio for less, so I never bought it) 2. Virtual Synths!

I’ll list my favorite synths in order from most used to least used!

Omnisphere is the synth I use the most, it’s a hybrid synth that uses thousands of samples and waveforms to generate very unique and complex sounds - it has a huge number of presets, and might be the most impressive virtual synth in the market, honestly, it’s so good, if you could afford the hefty $500 price tag, you won’t need any other synth I suggest to you on this list - that’s how comprehensive it is.  Serum is the Internets favorite bog-standard wavetable synthesizer, it’s great for a variety of sounds, but most comfortably works with heavy bass and EDM - it has a very clean sound, it has a nice list of effects and it’s only $189 U-HE Diva is a synth that emulates older, more vintage synths from the good ol days, it sounds phenomenal and works great in more chill genres, or, of course, outrun and 80s - it’s not too pricey at $200 but it’s very CPU intensive  Massive X is the resurgence of one of the most popular soft synths of the early 2010s that came out last month - I haven’t played with it, really, but I’ve heard good things, definitely not a bad choice if you plan on buying the Native instruments Komplete bundle, which is a great deal!  There are hundreds of synths out there, some very good ones I didn’t mention, however, these are the ones I use, and they’ll keep you preoccupied for a very long time. 

3. Effects

An equally important aspect for producing music is having effects and mixing and mastering plug-ins to louden your music, make it cleaner and crisper, or all around more interesting! The great thing about DAW’s like Pro tools, Ableton, and Cubase, is that they offer most of these effects included with the DAW - FL studio has a less comprehensive number of built-in effects, but thanks to this, is much cheaper - and frankly, sooner or later, you’re going to want to change the factory plug-ins for more professional 3rd party ones!

I use the ozone 8 and neutron 3 to mix and master my tracks, from Izotope!! Waves products is a good cheaper alternative and they often have sales! 

for reverbs (think of that cool echo effect you hear sometimes on voices) - I use vss3 and valhalla room - oftentimes, synths will come included with their own built in effects and reverbs, serum and omnisphere have great ones.

There are dozens more effects I didn’t get into in this list, but the learning process is quite high, so be sure to understand what saturation is, or a compressor, equalizers, Flanger, Phaser, Delays, LFO’s, and more! 

4. Hardware I use! 

So once you get used to the wonderful world of synthesis, or maybe you’re a pianist and want something physical right off the bat, you can get into hardware! It is very useful to buy yourself a MIDI piano if you plan on using a digital audio workstation! 

Just a warning! If you’re new, I’d suggest you don’t pick up these mutli-thousand dollar synths, I’d suggest checking out some cheaper synths by Korg or Roland, that may not offer as many features as the ones I’m about list, but will be good regardless, and will help you understand the world of synthesis. 

OP-1 - $1200 This is an incredibly unique piece of hardware, you could almost consider it a small physical, portable DAW! It’s so much fun to use and it’s great for getting ideas, its not nearly as comprehensive as a real DAW, however, and is limited by its own software! Moog Matriarch - $2000 this synth isn’t technically out yet, but it is the upgraded version to the Moog grandmother (which I own), which is a less powerful, smaller version of the upcoming matriarch! This synth oozes analog - if you plan on learning synths, you must learn the difference between analog gear and digital gear - but the matriarch and grandmother makes AMAZING use of its physical analog hardware, and offers you super rich, fat, complex tones, filters, and oscillators!  Prophet Rev 2 - $2000 This is one of my favorite analog synths I’ve ever owned, it has 16 voices, which means 16 notes can be played at a time (2 oscillators per note) - unlike the matriarch and grandmother, which can only play 4 or 1 note respectively - this one focuses on making the oscillators and filters less complex, but in turn, allowing a greater number of notes! That doesn’t mean it sounds worse, however, it just means the performance was allocated some place else - this synth sounds beautiful, and I use it often for huge pads and chords! (the moog is great for leads and bass!) Focusrite 2i4 - $169 This is a relatively cheap and popular audio interface that’s use to allow cleaner, faster and better playback! If you get into production, you’ll need an audio interface! It’s honestly, just good to have in general!  Desk I use is Platform by Output - $800 Speakers I use are the bower and wilkins 606 - $900 (I suggest rokit 5s to start) - must have amplifier for the wilkins (I use the emotiva Basx A-150) I have two really cool pedals, both by chasebliss audio, one called MOOD and the other called Warped Vinyl hi-fi - they both have a variety of uses, so please refer to their features on the site, these really are only useful if you have a lot of external gear! Both $349 I put all of my physical hardware through a Mackie ProFX 8v2 - A cheap and relatively compact mixer, directly into my audio interface!  I own a few hi-fi headphones (the ibasso sr1 and the Audeze LCD-X) but you really only need a good pair of studio headphones to get started, especially if you don’t want to deal with the expensive hassle of speakers right away! Check out audio technica and sennheiser for some great cheaper alternatives!  

Okay anyways! despite how long and intense this list may seem, this really isn’t everything I own, but it’s a good list of tools I most enjoy using, and tools I think can add a great deal of production value to your music !!! I’ll update this list as new things are added!!! 

I hope this helped! Remember, there’s nothing wrong with starting off much smaller!

HOOOOO WHAT DID I SAY I WAS GONNA DO??? Some things puki has in their room:

• Bluetooth speaker

• many boxed card games I think? Is one of them exploding kittens and another cah?

• an Alexa or google home thingy

• screwdriver

• Too Big Headphones

• [Probably] a box of ashes

• Box of hangers

• trash that needs Taken Out

• two (2) rolly chairs (who else lives here that you would need two for?)

• Rad Poster

• Rad Bedsheets

• Is that floss on your bed?

• light saber 

Some corrections:

I’d never own the exploding kittens card game because that shits so vanilla it hurts, every card game down there is pokemon. 

Thats not Google home or Alexa, that’s a humidifier. 

Those are the best headphones anyone could ever own, dont ever disregard them again.

I like having that much trash on me at all times, it’s the perfect amount of trash.

I have two rolly chairs because it makes it easy for friends to sit next to me on MY rolly chair so we can watch funny YouTube videos on my computer desk.

Hey do u know that one song that’s in every trailer that goes “FOR YOUUUU, FOR YOOUUU, OOO OOO OOOO O O OOO OO OO OOOOOO” ?????

Yeah that’s song is the embodiment mass extinction 

That song is the worst thing that’s ever been created. The solar debris that formed our earth 4.5 billion years ago was wasted on us because this song was one of its byproducts - we were better off a magma-ridden, lifeless planet than have this song be a thing that exists in this universe. I would erase this song from memory if it meant I had to live forever, see all my loved ones perish, watch the world burn and float ceaselessly in space for eternity — as long as that eternity was spent not having to know this fucking corporate cum-bucket of a song exists, I’d be chill. 

well now i have to listen to it

No you don’t. The song isn’t particularly bad, nor is it particularly good, it sits so delicately in-between being these two things that it becomes practically nothing - - - a purgatorial essence - a sad and quiet middle-ground. You would rather be known for being horrible than be nothing at all. 

for christ’s sake, just say it’s been stuck on a loop in your head for a week and go

Don’t assume this song has been stuck in my head, fool. Whenever I get a shitty song stuck in my head I simply think of “Scatmans World” to purge my mind-space of unfavorable thought. Works every time.

 So I’m watching this anime that has this scientist/doctor-type character who’s supposed to be really smart and cool - whatever. Anyways for some reason, the person who designed this character thought we’d forget that he’s a man of science or somethin, cause they stapled the theory of relativity right on to his left shoulder for no reason??? 

That’s fucking stupid, why did you do that? He’s a doctor, not a physicist… what the fuck is wrong with you. 

He himself wrote that on his clothes. It’s to make him remember there is hope. Read the manga.

e=mc² ≠ Hope 

Maybe that’s the wrong word, what he said was “And don’t forget..no matter how much this petrification seems like fantasy, a scientific foundation is the one thing that will never falter!!” which basically motivates him to continue trying to save every human in this stone world.

Okay okay fair enough, that’s a decent reason. But I’ll still probably only think of this as the Jared Leto “Damaged” forehead tattoo anime-equivalent

I swear every teen who’s slightly into music goes through the fucking superiority complex shit where they think THEIR music and what they listen to is the best and everything else is BAD because it’s popular or modern music is ‘trash’ or something like that. 

Lemme just say, as someone who’s been messing with music for over a decade, that if you think this way: you’re dumb as shit, your opinions are bad, and you gotta grow up chief. Modern music isn’t getting worse, your enjoyment in music isn’t any more valid than anyone else’s, music doesn’t need gatekeeping. And your psuedo-intellect is very silly to everyone else besides yourself.

There are two ways companies personify themselves. One way is pretty natural and fine and the other is stupid. Nintendo personified itself because their product and services built personality for their company, cause everyone loves a little mario and pokemon!! Then u have a burger company with no definable features compared to any other burger company, and so they get some intern to run a twitter and be unnecessarily sassy for crowd appeal and it just feels weird man. I still find it weird. Nintendo doesn’t need to sass their twitter followers to be enjoyed by people.

You mean some team of marketing executives. No relatable human intern is behind these accounts.

U know what? You’re absolutely right, they want you to assume it’s some intern, but with this shit you have to assume the worst, because they won’t tell you who runs it regardless. Its probably a team of focus-tested businessmen and it fucking sucks.

You’re only legally allowed to carry one weapon per the open carry law here in the US. You may only have one boy.

but he has 2 guns????

Each gun is loaded with exactly half the ammo, thus equaling one full gun

then why cant you half that ammo too and add it to 2 more guns, thus giving us tiddy cannons

Hey I hit a cumulative 100k views on spotify yay ! ! ! 

I started sharing my stuff around September, so this is only really 3-4 months of work, so that’s exciting (just gonna ignore the fact that slimetony got 1 mil plays this year alone)

But as someone who’s been working on music for the past 8 years, I’m real proud of this. Thanks.

I had a dream that Tumblr released a system on the site that’d give you points whenever someone reblogged or followed you and you could spend the points in a virtual shop that was owned by an ugly digital rat mascot. And you could buy different weapons and attack other blogs and destroy parts of their page.

The future we could’ve had :/

Now that smash hype has calmed down just for a little bit, I wanna quickly shout out another game that foolishly came out around the same time, Earth Defense force 5 is the stupidest most fun addictive game series and you owe it to yourself to play it. 

For example this dude goes “THE ALIENS LOOK JUST LIKE US, TWO ARMS, TWO LEGS AND A BODY” 

‘Almost identical to humans….’

And do you know what it is?

  When I think of myself 15 years from now, with two rando kids and a wife, and we’re eating some sub-par pasta in a fancy house and I’m like “honey this I delicious” and she says “thanks honey I love you” —- Is that really the dream? I don’t want that, I’d rather be hunting Sasquatch by myself in a dense forest than dealing with that shit.

That is not the dream! I’m divorced twice, no kids and living with my girlfriend who has two kids. It blows! I’m two weeks away from attaining my Splunk accredited Consultant certification so I can go on the road 75% of the year and make $125k+. That’s my dream.

Some anon got really pissed at me for selling those shirts. I just wanna say, if the thought of some college student selling shirts that people asked for pisses you off, you might want to reflect on that for a little bit. am I in the wrong here for feeling like it’s okay to sell shirts, akin to a small band or individual artist? I don’t particularly understand where the frustration comes from. as though I’m some sorta evil corporation or shady business, I’m just one dude lol.

The moral of the story is just that I want this to be you

  People being good at art and shit. Who do you think you are?

Artist

FUCK 

YOU

Look, I know I’m not an NSFW blog, or am in any way affiliated with NSFW shit, but many people dabble in both on here, there are those who built a community based around something intrinsically lewd - - that doesn’t make it any less valid or significant. Tumblr states on their twitter bio: “where your interests connect with your people” – but that’s absolute bullshit when you ban something as normalized and okay as nudity and lewd art.

NSFW artists are still artists trying to make due, NSFW photographers, amateur or not, still should have a platform to share their stuff with a community. 

Tumblr thinks that everything will become perfect and idealized once they remove the NSFW aspects from their site, but that’s not how forcibly removing content works – it doesn’t work, it pisses people off, it waters down the content on your site, and it destroys your already fragile reputation.

Tumblr never fucking listens, they refuse to listen, regardless of how much shit this site goes through, how much negativity it acquires, they make the worst decisions or no decision at all. They need to fucking learn, or they’ll lose something of value to many on here. They need to rethink their actions, and fast.

I’ll still be here, but catch me on twitter too. I now know the importance of expanding your following to more than one website.

People are always like “this fandom sucks” and “that fandom sucks” 

Here’s the truth about 99% of fandoms: once they’re popular enough to be unavoidable, they’re intrinsically ass. There is truth in that some fandoms are worse than others, for example, bronies are the lowest common denominator, as they attract a certain cesspool of people, but no matter how innocent the thing you’re fangirling over is, sooner or later, some asshole will come to ruin the peaceful state of your fandom, and it’ll bring other assholes, then your fandom is suddenly 1 million large and you’re within a sea of like-minded but different assholes, all with your own vision as to what this perfect fandom-utopia should act like. Suddenly, you’re a volunteering subject in some internet social experiment, a wave crashing abruptly and chaotically along the shores of the vast web. Unyielding and obnoxious to all onlookers.

U know idk why Rockstar had to make red dead 2 so scary. I’m almost certain half the length of the games production time was spent filling this game with scary shit. 

I don’t know why in my western action game I can stumble across a ghost woman staring at me from a second story window, a man hiding behind me in a mirror, whispers in the forest, two UFOs, Sasquatch, the literal rake, cannibals, a man who calls himself the devil hiding in a secret cave at the edge of the map, deformed bone creatures, glowing pentagrams, strange carvings, witches and serial killers, but you do you Rockstraar.

I’d say Rockstar since their games are consistently good, but they overwork their employee’s and GTA online was a massive scam. Valve HAD a decent track record but they only make garbage now. Sony and Nintendo are too big to have a clean track record. 
The only good game company so far that has not done me any wrong is Toby Fox.

  One time I was laying in bed at 2am eating some tasty ass raisins, and I was living life to the fullest. It was great, but somehow, a raisin managed not only to miss my mouth, but land somewhere on top of my head or something, because 30 minutes into hanging out in my bed eating raisins like a king, the rogue raisin fell out of my hair and onto my chest, and I straight up thought it was a beetle or a fucking spider, so I flipped the fuck out and the head-raisin bounced somewhere outta sight, and I spent that whole night, like 2 hours, just tearing apart my bed trying to find a bug, because I thought the head raisin was a fucking beetle.

Are you okay?

I always see people outside of tumblr complaining about how sjw or political it is, but it really isn’t, it’s 100% a customizable experience, like any other site. 

Like, H3H3 guy Ethan was complaining about how he went on tumblr and all he saw was furry porn or whatever – as someone who has been here 6 years, unless you’re flat out looking for furry porn you’re really not gonna find it that easily, almost certain he just looked up furry porn and then complained about it in front of everyone. Like, my dash has never had furry porn on it… it’s not that hard Ethan.

Catch me naming my child something stupid like “Gertrude” in 2021

If you name a child Gertrude they grow up to be a schoolteacher or a serial killer, and there’s no way to predict which.

Actually they’ll age immediately into an old person and be both. Good day.

Doctor: $140,000 a year

Furry artist on Patreon: $160,000 a year 

i think you’re lowballing the furry art amount tbh

I’m sorry for the inaccuracies, Doctor Yiff

no matter how I respond to this I don’t look good, well played. i walked right into that

Well, furry artists are typically more competent and courteous than your average doctor, so I can see that.

Did you just legitimately tell me that a person who draws wolf ass is more competent than a dude who spent 8+ years in a university to give you your lung transplant?

doctors are bullshit and furry artists perform an infinitely more valuable service to society compared to them

You will die in 7 days 

It took doctor’s like 10 years to diagnose what was wrong with me, some insisting I was faking for attention while a furry artist I knew just went “that sounds like crohn’s” after hearing me complain once and ended up being right

Also I can’t go to a doctor and ask them to draw Rouge the Bat wider than she is tall with tits to match, now can I

You could if you weren’t a fucking coward

Anyways I’ve been getting over 380,000 notes a month easily and now I’m getting supposedly less than 1,000 a day. The ‘best stuff first’ feature has downgraded this site a tremendous amount, not only is the feature destructive to smaller blogs, they also somehow fucked up the activity page, and is no longer accurate or useful. 

Staff on tumblr rarely responds to unanimous disapproval unless shoved in their face, so I’m asking you guys to spread this post, and others like it around as much as possible as to get the message into their thick heads - that this greatly devolves the tumblr experience.

Mario would give you gum without you having ask him for it 

Luigi probably owns his own candle-making workshop and he would occasionally give you free scented candles. He probably would change the scent depending on the season.

Toad would burn out his cigarette on your arm and bash you over the head with an empty vodka bottle

Waluigi would help you do your taxes then play a friendly match of one on one basketball.

Yoshi runs the largest crime syndicate seen this side of the Mushroom Kingdom, and he won’t hesitate to flex his power

  What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little profligate? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in Caesar’s Legion, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Hoover Damn, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in unarmed warfare and I’m the top spear thrower in the entire Legion. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with melee weapon skill the likes of which has never been seen before in Nevada, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, profligate. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Mojave and your coordinates is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, weakling. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, profligate. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my ballistic fist. Not only am I maxed out in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Praetorian Guard and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your inferior ass off the face of the desert, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn dissolute. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, profligate.

john ‘smokes that’ green

i dont think you do. john green is a famous young adult author, known for works such as The Fault in Our Stars and Looking For Alaska. hes also an awkward middle aged man who feels threatened by childrens post ironic internet humor. hes a very uncool nerd, the kind that i shove in lockers. “green” is also a slang term for marijuana, which i smoke a lot of because im cool, but the nerdy writer man doesn’t because he is a nerd. the joke is that john green has green in his name, and if his middle name was “smoke that” it would be entirely paradoxical, because john green is a nerd, and doesnt smoke weed like i do (i smoke a lot of weed)

I just saw interstellar. 

So I’m gonna give you a dated review of how I feel about it:

I don’t usually care about the opinions of others when it comes to film, I doubt you guys do either. This movie intrigued me, so I’m going to talk about it anyways.

As a science-junky and a huge fan of space, obviously I noticed the apparent flaws coming from some of the scenes in this movie. But, as the film piked my interests, I gave it an open-minded shot and thoroughly enjoyed what was there.

Yes, there are apparent problems with some of the scenes when you look at it from a scientific perspective. But damn, I go to metacritic and IMDB and you have these perfectionists ripping the movie apart for flaws it could hardly avoid. Like shit, yes, Ice clouds are licensed to some artistic leniencies… obviously.

These realists are telling Nolan to make the movie as scientifically accurate as it can be, down to the smallest details. Little do these scientists know that the main purpose of a triple A film is to make a profit from what’s IN the storyboard.

What pisses me off is that this film is getting one’s and zero’s for something entirely unavoidable, due to it either being not realistic enough, or, the more usual case when it comes to film reviews - the idiots who don’t get it in the first place! There’s a thin line between what makes a movie like this have a huge demographic and what makes it have none. That means sacrificing what could have made this film scientifically accurate.

This film in particular has some of the best compositions I’ve ever seen. The use of space and contrast of color is gorgeous. I’m incredibly sad I missed this film in theaters just because of how this movie is visually. It’s beyond any other space film in regards to visuals.

Not to mention the score is phenomenal, having heavy focus on organs, which, surprisingly fits the tone of being in deep space. I’ve never seen the organ be used for that purpose before, especially for this films tone and scope. The large chords that are able be played on such an instruments gives the soundtrack thick sound without over-complicating the score with too many other instruments.

The story gets a little bit expository near the end. There are some stretches in the film when it comes to the growth of a character, for instance, the daughter seeming to have figured out how to accomplish what she needs to do by staring at a watch and figuring out that it’s Morse code. The only flaws this film has comes from overlooking character growth.

Overall, this film deserves a Nani 9/10. If you ignore the incorrect scientific facts and minor plot slip-ups, this movie is an absolutely fantastic joy to watch. The visuals and score alone makes it an incredibly good film worth your time.

reblog this post with the oldest meme you can think of

Many believe that this is the very first true internet meme, it was even passed around on paper during its beginning years

Leetspeak (1980s)

Ben Huh, CEO Cheezburger

“1337speak,” read as leetspeak, is a corrupt style of the English language marked by liberal interchanging of numbers and symbols in place of certain letters that arose from the so-called “leet” (“elite”) subculture of hackers in the late 1980s, and later, gamers in the 1990s.

Though now considered an outdated vernacular, 1337speak established a way to “be cool” on the Internet and left many other lasting legacies in the online gaming world – most notably “n00bs.”

I don’t know why people hate EVERY little thing the staff does to an update. They constantly talk about change, but when it happens on this site, thousands get upset. 

They fix things that do not need to be fixed and ignore the things we want fixed.

I don’t know a lot about coding and its difficulties, but I’d imagine having to change the entire way things load on a website to be a difficult task. Maybe - they’re working on the larger things, and are fine tuning them, so they won’t get ransacked when they publish the “video player” update or something along those lines !

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

[Chorus x 2]

If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe 

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

He came to town like a midwinter storm 

He rode through the fields so handsome and strong 

His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun 

But all he had come for was having some fun 

[Chorus x 2]

If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe 

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

 
He brought disaster wherever he went 

The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent 

They all ran away so nobody would know 

and left only men cause of Cotton-Eye Joe 

[Chorus x 2]

If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe 

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

[Chorus x 2]

If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe 

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe 

 
If it hadn’t been for Cotton-Eye Joe 

I’d been married long time ago 

Where did you come from where did you go 

Where did you come from Cotton-Eye Joe

“Happy New Years, everyone!! I can’t believe it’s already 2015” Shinji Ikari said as he partied like there was no tomorrow. “I bet this is going to be the best year ever!!” he said full of life and joy.

“Shinji,” Obama said with a sigh. “I’m glad you are celebrating the new year and all, but dont you think there are more pressing matters to attend to?" 

"I know its new years, but its time for you to get into the fucking robot.”

Shinji Ikari put down his Starbucks Mocha Light Frappuccino® Blended Coffee, looked at Obama right in the eyes and said “I voted for Ron Paul.”

Season 3

Season 4

Season 5

Season 6

The only reason why there’s no Season 1 is, they don’t have the gag reel for that season. Also, there are subtitles in Season 2 because I suck and couldn’t get rid off it for some unknown reasons. Other than that, I hope you enjoy the gag reel.

I just

dislike the idea that a ‘happy ending’ is base and boring

that an ending that is depressing and angsty and full of darkness automatically makes it “something more”

There’s basic reasoning as to why that’s universally considered true. Happy endings leave nothing to expand upon. It’s easy to tie things up in a tidy knot and finish things there. It takes a lot of effort to produce a setting that, even after the primary plot has been dealt with, can be expanded upon. That unknown is what drives curiosity and requires thought.

theundeadastronaut replied to your post “I spent half the night downloading the madoka films and they finally…”

You should get VLC Player. It’s free and plays most video formats. Or go to KissAnime. They have high quality videos with no interrupting ads and I know for a fact they have the Madoka films because I’m currently rewatching them there.
Wow it’s really great quality on KissAnime! Thank you! I’m lil bummed my 24 gig download didn’t work correctly. I couldn’t find that vlc player you spoke about.

Thanks!

Being able to find someone you click with so naturally is the best feeling ever. You feel like you’ve been best friends you’re whole life, it feels like you’re coming home. You’re so comfortable with them. Maybe that’s what a soulmate is. Not someone who shares every single thing in common with you, but someone who feels like home.

Can I have $150?” Me: “No problem.” Customer: *after paying* “Can you do me a favor?” *she hands me the gift card* “The next customer you see that you think could use this, could you give it to them?” Me: *stunned* “…Of course!” (After a minute another customer comes up, a visibly upset young woman.) Me: “Hi! How are you?” Customer #2: “I’m okay, thanks.” (Clearly she is not ok, but she is trying very hard to be pleasant. She is getting very basic items: milk, bread, eggs, etc. Nothing very festive.) Me: “So your total comes out to $0.00.” Customer: “What?” Me: “The person before you gave me a $150 gift card to use for the next person I thought could use it. You look like you’re having a rough day, so here are your groceries, and there’s about $130 left on this card.” (The customer just started crying. Once she could, she thanked me about 100 times. Made my whole Christmas season.)
